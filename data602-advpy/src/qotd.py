#1. What are the similarities and differences between pandas and numpy?   Include some type of example with code.

"""
They are both python libraries used for data manipulation, but they mostly do different things. Numpy is low-level number-crunching system mostly, think of linear algebra, scientific math, and multiplying math matrices together. Pandas is more widely used as columnar format data manipulation, think anything you can do in excel, but a whole lot more, and with a whole lot more excel sheets at the same time.

Most in this field probably don't know a lot about Numpy, but most of Pandas's math functionality runs on the Numpy API. 
Pandas is huge and maybe it's all you need most of the time, but know that your code is most likely running through Numpy.


Here's a simple example.


In [1]: import numpy as np
   ...: import pandas as pd
   ...:
   ...: # Caffeine content in ounces
   ...: # Diet Drinks, Energy Drinks, Sugar-Free Drinks
   ...: np_caffeine = np.array([[12, 10, 8], [30, 35, 40], [10, 12, 15]])
   ...:
   ...: # Creating a DataFrame with Pandas
   ...: pd_caffeine = pd.DataFrame(np_caffeine,
   ...:                            columns=["Drink 1", "Drink 2", "Drink 3"],
   ...:                            index=["Diet Drinks", "Energy Drinks", "Sugar
   ...: -Free Drinks"])
   ...:
   ...: # Example Operation: Calculating the average caffeine content for each c ategory
   ...: # Using NumPy
   ...: np_mean_caffeine = np.mean(np_caffeine, axis=1)
   ...:
   ...: # Using Pandas
   ...: pd_mean_caffeine = pd_caffeine.mean(axis=1)
   ...:
   ...: print("Average Caffeine Content with NumPy:", np_mean_caffeine)
   ...: print("Average Caffeine Content with Pandas:\n", pd_mean_caffeine)
Average Caffeine Content with NumPy: [10.         35.         12.33333333]
Average Caffeine Content with Pandas:
 Diet Drinks          10.000000
Energy Drinks        35.000000
Sugar-Free Drinks    12.333333
dtype: float64



2. What is the ndarray in numPy?

N-dimensional-array, aka ndarray,  is the most core structure in numpy. To use this data type, you load data and then put it into one of these ndarrays. From there, the ndarray is an engine. You can ue it to slice, index, search, apply math, etc. And it's fast. NDArray was designed with one thing in mind, to be fast. 



3. Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9 
Desired Output:  array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

## 3 answer ## 
In [5]: import numpy as np
   ...:
   ...: array_range = np.arange(10)
   ...: print(array_range)
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]


## 4. Extract all odd numbers from array1 
array1 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

## 4 answer ## 
[x for x in array1 if x % 2 != 0]


## 5. Get the common items between a and b  
#input
a = np.array([1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5,6])
b = np.array([7,2,10,2,7,4,9,4,9,8])
#Desired Output:
array([2, 4])

## 5 answer ## 
In [13]: common_elements = np.intersect1d(a, b)
    ...: print(common_elements)
[2 4]



6. From array a remove all items present in array b 
#Input:
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
b = np.array([5,6,7,8,9])
#Desired Output:
array([1,2,3,4])

## 6 answer ## 
result = np.setdiff1d(a, b)
print(result)



7. Find out if iris has any missing values. 
# Input
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
iris = np.genfromtxt(url, delimiter=',', dtype='float', usecols=[0,1,2,3])

I don't think it's missing anything, but I'm not really sure.  Usually if you're asking for missing data it's either from a time series, or it's n records from population N. This is neither of those. It could e missing a field within a row, so we can check for that.

Also, pandas understands the structure within the csv reader, so I used that.


In [36]: import pandas as pd
In [37]: url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
In [38]: iris = pd.read_csv(url)
In [39]: pd.isnull(iris).any()
Out[39]:
5.1            False

1.4            False

## let's use the same dataset we used last week.
import pandas as pd
usecols=['Fate', 'Department/Class', 'Passenger/Crew', 'Adult/Minor', 'Sex', 'Position']
cuny  = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonythor/cuny-datascience"
lusitania = pd.read_csv(f"{cuny}/develop/data/lusitania_manifest.csv") 
lusitania.columns = lusitania.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_').str.replace('/', '_')

# 1. How would you delete:
## An index from your dataframe
lusitania = lusitania.reset_index(drop=True)
# A column from your dataframef
lusitania = lusitania.drop('position', axis=1)
    # A row from your dataframe
lusitania = lusitania.drop(0, axis=0)

# 2. How do you iterate over a pandas dataframe?
for  row in lusitania.iterrows():
    print(f"Row:{row}")

# 3. How would you convert a string to a date?    
from datetime import datetime
moon_landing = "1969-07-16"
d = datetime.strptime(moon_landing, "%Y-%m-%d").date() #<- not a datetime! 
print(type(d))

# 4. What is data aggregation?  Give an example in Python. 
# It's rolling up data. You might want reduce hourly data to daily data, 
# or something more like groupBy().count(). GroupBy/count or GroupBy/Sum
# are probably the two most common types of aggregations. 

sex_count = lusitania.groupby('sex').size()
print(sex_count)
# sex
# Female     518
# Male      1443



# 5. What is GroupBy in Pandas (groupby()). Give an example in Python.
# let's use groupby and bins together.
lusitania_age = (
    lusitania['age']
    .pipe(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')  # Convert 'age' to numeric, coerce errors to NaN
    .dropna()                              # Drop NaN values
    .astype(int)                           # Convert remaining 'age' values to integers
)

bins = range(0, max(lusitania_age) + 10, 10)
labels = [f"{i}-{i+9}" for i in range(0, max(lusitania_age), 10)]
age_groups = pd.cut(lusitania_age, bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)
age_group_counts = age_groups.value_counts().sort_index()
print(age_group_counts)
# age
# 0-9       73
# 10-19     73
# 20-29    337
# 30-39    389
# 40-49    212
# 50-59    117
# 60-69     28
# 70-79      6
# Name: count, dtype: int64



# 1. What is matplottlib and seaborn?  When would you choose one over the other?

# Matplotlib is like a basic art set for graph drawing in Python. It's great for simple and customizable graphs, like lines and dots. Seaborn is like an advanced art kit that builds on Matplotlib. It makes fancier and more complex graphs easier, like those showing trends in lots of data. When to choose which? Use Matplotlib for simple graphs. When you have lots of data and want nicer looking graphs without much extra work, go for Seaborn.


# 2. Image you are creating a visualization for a presentation at work.  What are some recommendations or guidelines you would follow to make engaging and informative visuals?

# I have a few suggestions for graphics.
# 1. Simple is better. If your high school child can't understand it, it's probably not done.
# 2. Don't need to show everything, just show what you need to show.
# 3. Use colors and legends to make things crystal clear.
# 4. Use tangible metrics and labels. "$1.2BN" is easier to read on a chart than "1200000000" or "1.2e9"


# 3. Give an example of either a matplotlib or seaborn graphic (give code). 

# Here's a simple but super clear example you can cut and paste.

    lusitania['age'].pipe(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce'), 
    bins=bins, 
    labels=labels, 
    right=False
)
grouped_data = lusitania.groupby(['fate', 'age_group']).size().unstack(fill_value=0)

# 4. Read the following: https://speedwell.com.au/en/insights/2019/the-manifesto-of-the-data-ink-ratio  What is the data-ink ratio? 

# It's the fictitious percentage of ink on a chart that is for showing data, versus for not showing data. The concept is -- use your ink to show data and don't use any ink to show stuff that's not data. 

# How can you use python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc. to incorporate this data-ink ratio in your visualizations?
#
# I don't quite understand the wording of that question. I think a better question is, with respect to the data-ink ratio, what can we do with our plots and charts to make graphics more legible. The answer is pretty simple, keep the chart to just the fact you are trying to show. Filter out everything that isn't exactly what you want to show. If your graphic is exploratory and you're not showing something specific, even then show just the exploratory data you are showcasing and nothing else (except labels and legends)
