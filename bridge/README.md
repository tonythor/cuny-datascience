**Course Name and Number:** CUNY MSDS Bridge Workshop – Summer 2023

**Credits:** non-credit course

**Prerequisite(s):** Admission to Master of Science in Data Science

## Course Descriptions:

The Bridge workshop is divided into three course tracks:

1. SQL
2. RProgramming
3. Data ScienceMath

Due to many entering MSDS students taking two or more of the Bridge workshops, there is a single weekly discussion topic that is shared across the three course tracks. Some topics are shared across tracks, such as "Using GitHub" in week 1. The material in the Data Science Math track requires that you are either taking R Programming concurrently or come in with some decent R knowledge.

## Course Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- SubmitandmanagetheirworkinGitHub_[all__tracks]_
- WritequeriesthatcombineandaggregateinformationfrommultipletablesinMySQL _[SQL track]_
- WritemoderatelycomplexRprogramsandpresenttheirfindingsinRStudioand rpubs.com _[R Programming__Track]_
- Using Python, solve basic math, linear algebra, and statistics problems. _[Data __Science__ Math_ _track]_

## Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course_:_

Prepare students for success in CUNY's Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program,especially607:DataAcquisitionandManagementand606:Introduction to Statistics andProbability.

## How are these workshops relevant for Data Science professionals?

Workingwithdata,programming,probability,statistics,andlinearalgebraarecore competencies for all data sciencework.

## Instructions for Dialing in to Weekly Meetups

**Instructions for connecting to the MSDS Bridge meetups can be found in the workshop folder called "Meetup and Office Hours".** Use your microphone and speakers (VOIP) for audio. You'll sound best with a headset. You can also call in using your telephone. If you do call in to the meeting, please remember to disable the microphone on your computer; otherwise, all the other participants will experience an "echo" effect!

## Office Hours:

Office Hours (cell phone or by Zoom, where we can screen share): by appointment throughout the week. Please ask questions on the "Ask Your Instructor" forum on the course discussion board where other students will be able to benefit from your inquiries. For the most part, you can expect a response to questions by email within 24 to 48 hours. If you get stuck, please ask for help!

## How This Course Works

**Meet-ups on Thursdays; Assignments due on following Sundays!** This course is conducted entirely online. Here is what your weekly workload and deliverable schedule will look like:

- Eachweek'smaterialisavailableafter5:00p.m.EDTontheFridaybeforethatweek'smeet-up.
- You'll have a list of readings. There will also be a number of short videos to watch over the five weeks.

- There is a short, lightly graded discussion topic each week. Your initial post is due before the Tuesdaymeet-up,andyourresponseisdueendofdaythefollowingFriday.
- There are course meet-ups every Thursday. Call in detailsbelow.

- For each course track, you'll submit 3 **weekly**  **assignments** (due end of day EDT on the Sunday after the meet-up) and possibly a **final**  **project** (with a short **presentation** of your final project). Students areexpectedtocompleteallassignmentsbytheirduedates.Anyworkturnedinaftertheduedate willreceiveamaximumscoreof80%.Ifsolutionshavebeenpostedforanassignmentbeforeyou've turned it in, you'll need to propose an alternative assignment acceptable to the instructor. Future datascientistspleasetakenote:thereisanoverwhelminglypositivecorrelationbetweenhowearly studentsturnintheirassignmentsandtheircoursegrades!
- There will often be short ungraded "hands on labs" that will help you prepare for your assignments.
- Working in teams on the projects is strongly encouraged, but not required. The ability to work effectively on virtual teams is an important "soft skill" for datascientists.
