Office Hours.   You're encouraged to schedule one-on-one meetings as needed.  I'll use doodle, or e-mail me about a time to meet.  I'd much rather field questions about your weekly assignments during the week than when the day that they are due (when you should be in "polishing" mode).

Notes: Larry Fulton is an active consultant, faculty member, and researcher.  He is a retired military officer and an active pilot.

Office Hours:  I will schedule time as needed to help you with questions.  Please give me some lead time before assignments are due.  Best bet is to email me or text me and we can set something up.
