# Story - 1 : Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Funding Allocation
To build, `quarto render ./myfile.qmd` 

Instructions:  The attached Excel file contains data on the present allocation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding by State and Territory. Your story (Data Visualization(s)) should address the following questions: Is the allocation equitable based on the population of each of the States and Territories or is bias apparent? Does the allocation favor the political interests of the Biden administration?

Notes:

* You will need to source data on the current (estimated) population of each of the States and Territories (accuracy is more important than precision) and on the official election results of the 2020 Presidential election.
*  For the first assignment, you will complete the graphical analysis in Excel.
* I want no more than two visualizations for this assignment and a single paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that addresses both questions above and demonstrates how and where the graphics directly answer them. 
* This assignment is due by the end of week two of the semester.  Be sure to look at the grading rubric.
* You will need to submit it via .pdf.  All stories will be submitted in .pdf format, regardless of the software used, and they should reflect business professionalism.
