Hotel Grad Otočec,Ivet Sotirova,4,"More than a great and magical place. Clean, tasty, unique for walks, suitable for children and for a nice holiday. BUT... we come here for the 3rd time. Last year we were there on the 9th of September and there was a big party downstairs in the restaurant, we were assured it would be over by 10.30pm. At 11 p.m. in the evening I went down because my daughter couldn't sleep because of the noise and to check what was going on because the whole hotel smelled of cigarettes and the music was very loud. The party didn't end until 1:40... my disappointment was great then.  This year 18.06 we are guests of the hotel again, everything was again very clean, tasty, wonderful, the cosmetics in the hotel are very high class, the staff is great polite and smiling, but there were masters right outside our door exactly at 8:20 in the morning... for me this is not normal as a place where you come to rest with your family and sleep till 10. The experience with the ducks and the swan is very nice!"
Hotel Grad Otočec,Gordana Podvezanec,5,"The Otočec castle, built on one of the islands in the Krka river, is the only castle in Slovenia that is completely surrounded by water. Its present architecture originates from the transitional period between the Romanesque and the Gothic eras.  The original unfortified building with a rectangular ground plan was later expanded, giving it an L-shape. To protect the castle from Turkish assaults, a new outer wall was added and fortified with towers at the corners.  The castle park on the island was created under the Schweiger – Larchenfeld family (1727-1850), but its original form has been lost to the centuries. With the beautiful island park, the castle reflected in the clear water of the Krka river and the white mute swans, Otočec is truly a magical place."
Hotel Grad Otočec,Blaž Lusavec,5,"Very tasty large cup of cappuccino and very good fresh ice cream 👌And for a 5 star hotel in a castle on an island on a river for very resonable and affordable price. Oh yes, and very friendly staff."
Hotel Grad Otočec,Uros R.,5,A beautiful castle to visit on an island on Krka river.  To see more details you can visit my youtube channel Big Joe Cheap Travels
Hotel Grad Otočec,Bogdan Tertinek,5,"This magnificent five-stars hotel hosts also a Michelin Plate restaurant where the chef Nejc Ban and his team realise their talents. The castle has an attractive architecture influenced by different styles over several centuries, the interior was carefully renovated, rooms are pleasant and nicely furnished using natural materials, only some minor details divide the guest´s impression from perfection. The ambiance of the restaurant is superb, you can check its photos by yourself, I can highly recommend their 5-course degustation menu, which offers a wide spectrum of authentic tastes, ingredients are mainly local, the individual dishes are presented very well by competent waiters. Also the other hotel staff are very professional, attentive and helpful. To sleep and dine within castle walls is a special experience...enjoying a cup of tea beside a fireplace is unforgettable. Overall, it is a charming and impressive place, I truly couldn´t recommend it enough for example for special occasions like romantic getaways or celebrations of jubilees."
Reszel Castle,john wheatcroft,5,"Great place to stay. Good choice of beers food was ok. If on motorbike you may be able to park in courtyard,but access is up hill all on cobbles"
Reszel Castle,Paweł,5,"The Reszel castle, an Ordensburg fortress, was built in between 1350 and 1401 by the Teutonic Order.  In the nineteenth century it was adapted into a prison, next it was fully renovated after the Second World War. Currently the castle houses the museum , hotel and a restaurant."
Reszel Castle,Skirmantas J.,5,Romantic castle experience. We stayed for one night and completely enjoyed our stay 💯
Reszel Castle,Tom Zyskowski,5,"Super place and experience, we stayed overnight. Good food and beer."
Reszel Castle,Szymon Leszczyński,5,Very nice and small castle for a touristic stroll or even staying the night. We didn't stay the night but were only visiting the sites.  Seeing the whole site took about 1h. There was the torture chamber and walk up to the tower. There is a restaurant right inside which looke nice. Beware: strollers are usually a bad idea here because of the various stairs.
Zamek w Krasiczynie | Hotel | Restauracja Rene...,Amarok Sh,4,"Castle itself is awesome, however park is somehow wild. As to hotel, rooms are large and beds are comfy, bathroom requires renovations. Breakfast is moderate"
Zamek w Krasiczynie | Hotel | Restauracja Rene...,Anya Nura,4,"Rather beautiful palace that you can see both inside and outside. The inside has several halls that you can visit with a guide. The walls are nicely restored and the palace looks quite nice. And you can also go around the palace and enjoy the garden. Of course, it’s better to do in warm time of the year. There is on-site hotel next to the palace where you can stay. There is a restaurant on the ground as well. Please, note that you need to pay to enter this park. Parking is also possible inside if you visit the restaurant. If you visit the park/palace only, you need to find parking outside. In general it’s a good place to visit, take a walk, try some food, etc."
Zamek w Krasiczynie | Hotel | Restauracja Rene...,Cursed Spongebob,5,Big pond big and nice rooms would recommend
Zamek w Krasiczynie | Hotel | Restauracja Rene...,Chris Martinez,5,Stay at a castle.. it’s nice!
Zamek w Krasiczynie | Hotel | Restauracja Rene...,Sam,5,"Amazing castle, steeped in history. Absolute must for a visit if you are in this part of Poland. Well worth getting a guided tour great story telling by the guide too (although hardly impartial!). It does, however have a fascinating history. Dungeons are interesting too, in a weird sort of way, never ceases to amaze me how cruel people can be to each other."
Riegersburg Castle,Rea Rubio-Stock,5,"It was an amazing tour! The audio translator helps of understanding the history, glad they have it for free! I did enjoy the inside castle tour and the amazing scenic view outside from the top going down to the city👍🏻"
Riegersburg Castle,Åsa Hidmark,4,"Firstly, we did the schnitzel jagt and it was too difficult for us 😬. No seriously we went to all the three museums, Hexen, Waffen, Burg. There was alot of informative text, however sometimes too much, if you go with kids. None of the text on the walls was in English (obs audio may have been available in English I don’t know). Its well worth a visit. The playground outside is great. The insights into the brutality of the rule of the nobility is gruesome."
Riegersburg Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"Fortress on the rock. A fortress with a double moat. A fortress that has not been conquered by anyone for many centuries. The fortress was built by Rüdiger in 1122. However, the fortress got its current appearance in the 17th century. The fortress belongs to the Liechtenstein family since 1822. Now the exposition of the fortress consists of 3 museums - the Museum of Weapons, the Museum of Witches (many people were accused and killed for witchcraft, for wreaking havoc, for drought, for bad weather, etc.) and the Museum of the Castle itself. Very interesting. The entrance ticket costs 21.50 euros. Interesting, beautiful, nice view!"
Riegersburg Castle,Daniel Coulton Shaw (daniel shaw),5,Amazing day trip for the family. Great Ferrara which ends in the restaurant and a very interesting castle tour with weapons and witches.  Afterwards try a trip for cake and coffee to the nearby zotter chocolate factory.
Riegersburg Castle,Bernadett Turul,4,"Really pretty place to visit during summer. They use a cable car to get you up to the castle. You can also get an audio guide to learn more about the history of the castle. The castle hosts a witch museum, a weapon museum.  The only downside is the price and the lack of english speaking knowledge. Fortunately when we went there with family, one of the employees could speak English, but otherwise we would have to use hand gestures or translator apps."
Kost,Brian Webber,5,Great display of medieval swordsmanship and horse riding. The show was great for children and funny for those who understand Czech. Castle tour was interesting - there's an extra description available in English.
Kost,Brian Stukel,5,"Went with friends and family from the USA. For some it was their first experience with a real castle.  Loved it! To listen to 40 year old ""boys"" talking excitedly about which weapons they would prefer during the times of castles was priceless."
Kost,Joe Lobotka,4,"Very scenic and popular castle in the heart of Czech Paradise.  If you drive in earlier in the morning, you can face issues with securing a parking spot nearby. There's also an alternative (safer) option to leave the car on some free spot few kms down the forest hiking trail and take an easy walk to the castle.  I arrived just before the tours started and there was a surprising amount of people already waiting to enter (> 100). Because the castle's name is ""Kost"", which can be translated as a ""bone"", the castle very dog-friendly.  There is also a restaurant, several Czech fast food kiosks and an outside grill specialties venue in the back, but I found the servings small and quite overpriced. They also draft a locally brewed beer.  Nice place to visit for an hour or two if you happen to be around. However, I wouldn't come here from a far away."
Kost,katherine197,5,The best preserved gothic castles in the area. I highly recommend visiting! Our tour guide was amazing and answered any questions we had.
Kost,April Hoskins,5,Beautifully restored medieval castle with rooms thoughtfully decorated to give an idea of living and customs of the eras. Highly recommend a visit.
Karlštejn Castle,Nick Ivanov (William von Bock),4,"The outside of the castle is amazing. I was on an excursion on the first route - rather meager in the sense that there are very few exhibits and everything that is rather boring and uninteresting. Also, be prepared for the fact that there will be children, especially small ones, who will cry, run, and in every possible way interfere with listening to the guide. But in general, the castle is very beautiful and classy."
Karlštejn Castle,Sabina Mostafa,5,Beautiful castle and the village. We went by train from Prague main train station. It's cost us £18 up and down. Spend only few hours. Wish could go earlier. But managed to have a tour inside the castle last one.
Karlštejn Castle,Brian Planchard,5,"A very impressive castle outside of Prague that used to house the Bohemian Crown Jewels. Once you park in the lot at the base of the town, you can either walk to 2 km up the hill to the castle or pay a van service to take you to near the castle. I used the van service, it was worth it. The castle itself has several tours, I went on the Charles IV apartments tour, which only goes into two of the three main buildings. The high tower is a separate tour that was sold out. The tour I went on was nice, though I wish everything was included in one tour. There is pretty good mead for sale in the well tower, I wish I had bought more."
Karlštejn Castle,24juozas,5,"Its about 20min walk from parking to castle,when you enter the main street you can  see beutiful view of the castle from down bellow,U can get 3 tours in the castle,each one with the guide,lots of inn's,snack corners and gift shops on the road to castle."
Karlštejn Castle,James VanderWier,5,Excellent bathrooms and cafe up at the castle. Also were street vendors in the courtyard serving food and beer. Not a bad wake in that environment at all! Great view of the city or rather town below. The tour of the castle itself was engaging and interesting. Just about the right length of time.
Franzensburg,Jarosław Budzisz,5,"Very nice castle to visit (even if it was build quite recently despite the look of it). Located on the beautiful island surrounded by even more impressive park. You can take a walk around, rest a bit in the provided double sunbeds. There is a restaurant in the castle and the toilet and you can get there by small ferry. All available for people in wheelchair."
Franzensburg,Thomas Jedi,5,This is a small yet beautiful and well maintained castle surrounded by water. There are several small shops and restaurants for catching some refreshments. It also is a nice area for relaxing and for scenic walks. Plan on some extra time here to enjoy every bit :)
Franzensburg,Sofia Boneva,5,The place feels like it’s out of a Disney movie. The museum is only available with a tour for 11 euros but the tour is interesting and the inside of the castle is surprisingly beautiful. It also has a shop and a free toilet.
Franzensburg,Jelena Pekovic,5,"Beautiful day trip from Vienna! Lot of place for walking and enjoying incredaible environment! Not to be missed, especially during spring and summer!"
Franzensburg,Miodrag Cehajic,5,"The castles in an idyllic park. You can stay a while and recharge your batteries. You can take a long walk through the woods and meadows or along the water, park benches invite you to linger. There is also a playground and electric boats to borrow, a café and a snack bar. The park offers many beautiful subjects for photos and you can walk for several hours and enjoy nature."
Castle Blatná,Roman Perov,5,"I had a wonderful time visiting Blatna Castle and its deer park. The castle is a hidden gem, with a beautiful exterior and interesting history. The guided tour inside the castle was informative and engaging, giving a great insight into the life of nobility in the past. The deer park is a peaceful and serene oasis, with well-maintained pathways and plenty of deer roaming freely. It was a joy to observe the deer up close, and feeding them was an unforgettable experience. The castle grounds are picturesque and offer many opportunities for stunning photos. Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Blatna Castle and deer park for its beauty, tranquility, and historical significance"
Castle Blatná,Irina Emelyanenko,5,Nice castle. But the main attraction is deer feeding so don’t forgot to take some carrots with you (local deers love them)
Castle Blatná,Miguel Cuenca Fafutis,5,"Fantastic place to walk and visit on weekends.  The park is huge and walking relaxes you and you see the deer pass by your side.  You can offer them special food (carrot) that you take there. Going around with the lamas is a great experience.  The events that are organized in the place are an opportunity to learn about local products and try international food, drinking some wine, drinking beer or just resting."
Castle Blatná,kat cz,5,"Beautiful zámek and park, great place to visit with friends and family in a very affordable ticket you can buy online for 30kč. they have restaurants inside. nothing to worry when you get lost in this town, you can find so many things to enjoy."
Castle Blatná,Oksana Veber,5,"When visiting Blatna Castle,  make time to see Breznice sculpture bridge, and Castle,"
Šaleško Muzejsko in zgodovinsko društvo Velenje,mevludin osmanagić,4,"It's a shame, because everything is randomly imposed"
Šaleško Muzejsko in zgodovinsko društvo Velenje,Zvone Hranjec,5,The museum and its surroundings are beautifully decorated
Chateau Žleby,Chris Micsak,5,Great surprise chateau in the Czech countryside. They have English language books that are very informative if they don’t have English language tours. I like to think id be an incredible eccentric wealthy castle owner much like one of the owners of Žleby. Do you fancy a selection of medieval armor? Me too. How about a 4 barreled shotgun? Ya thought so. Do you fancy Crystal and china collections from the 1800s YA THATS WHAT I’M SAYING. Btw theres a Doge Room.
Chateau Žleby,Irina Mironova,5,"The castle is very beautiful with well-preserved internal interayer. Small and very cozy. Many rooms are preserved as they were more than 160 years ago, as evidenced by the surviving paintings of the premises. Some rooms are upholstered in cowhide or deer skin, many preserved household items. The atmosphere is calming and relaxing, no no extra people and sounds. The tour lasts only an hour, but passes unnoticed. I don’t know for sure if there is a possibility of conducting an excursion in English, you need to clarify in advance."
Chateau Žleby,Vojtech V,5,"Lovely place ideal for a half-day visit. Historic talks and walks a few times a day. Refreshments, outdoor seating and bike racks make it a fine destination for on foot, by bike or by car visitors."
Chateau Žleby,Branko Pleadin,5,"Very big castle from 13th century, renewed during 20th century. The owners of the castle made a very large collection of medeival weapons and other stuff that can be seen during visit to castle rooms."
Chateau Žleby,psbuser1 Thunderbird,4,"A very enjoyable castle visit in Eastern Bohemia. Worth a detour. If the weather is nice the grounds of the castle park will make your visit even better. The castle has an interesting history, and a visit will enable you to encounter fine furniture and objets d'art as they were in the 19th century. We did consider the entrance fee kind of steep, but we don't regret the visit."
Festetics Palace,Jiří Vojtíšek,4,"A very beautiful castle surrounded by well maintained gardens. The tour is definitely worth it, since the inside is filled with interesting items and pieces of furniture  with the library as a highlight. Also the view from the viewtower is nice. The signs are in English as well."
Festetics Palace,Sionainne Costello,5,"Really decently priced to see everything here, if you wish to see everything I would give it a full day, but just the palace and one exhibit still took about 2 to 3 hours, pretty gardens to sit in which are free of charge as well. DSLR Photography or videography inside the palace requires, 1400 HUF extra, really recommend"
Festetics Palace,Gadi Segal,5,"An interesting palace with breath taking decorations, fairnachers, pictures and rich history. The palace radiates an impressive but quiet power. There is a very beautiful view from the main tower. After visiting  the palace you can enjoy yourself from the nice park around it."
Festetics Palace,T Mckay,5,"Fantastic place and very well kept. If you visit the castle and their other exhibits, it could be a whole day program. Restaurants right by the entrances to be avoided."
Festetics Palace,Iva Drvarič,5,We didn't go inside but even a stroll around the beautiful park (whic is free) is a really nice experience. The palace is beautiful and well mantained. Definitelly worth a visit.
Bratislava Castle,jeremy kalous,5,"Castle is well worth the visit - and it’s free. The view is great. But, the museum costs money ….. however, it’s half price for seniors and students and it’s absolutely brilliant. I rushed around and that took two hours. It’s massive. Archaeological and History. Great icon art. It’s well worth a visit"
Bratislava Castle,Jesse (JP),5,"It was a one in a life time experience for me and my family. The history was incredible, and the views were fantastic. If you ever decide to take a backpacking trip across Eastern Europe with a friend or family, you have got to stop and take your amazing pictures here! And go through the museum too."
Bratislava Castle,Jarrod Hunt,4,"Lovely castle grounds that you can look around for free. Didn't go into the museum as we didn't have the time. Good views from up there, though they could do with some information boards, there is literally zero information. It is a free site though, so can't complain too much"
Bratislava Castle,Austin Graff,5,"Skip the museum and go for the city views, a shaded playground, and public art on the grounds. My six-year-old daughter enjoyed the small playground as my wife and I sat on lawn chairs under a tree and read. It was so peaceful! We spent a good hour relaxing and playing on the playground before exploring more of the city."
Bratislava Castle,Sze Yee Ong,5,"Beautiful castle on top of hill. The views from there are amazing. There is also a playground there in the shade. There are chairs around for the adults. The grounds are free to visit, which is fantastic. The baroque gardens are well maintained and beautiful."
Křivoklát Castle,Surupa Chaki,5,"Beautiful countryside castle with big courtyard. Surrounded by beautiful greens, small hiking trail around. Pros frequent train connections Cons no English tours However it is a great day trip from Prague. There are events as well during summer, please check calanders. In those times courtyard is paid else it is free."
Křivoklát Castle,Vit Spisek (Vyyt),5,"A beautiful medieval castle perched on a hill surrounded by forest. Great views from the tower(s). Only a few foreign tourists, less crowded than other famous castles. We had a fun day trip from Prague by a retro train."
Křivoklát Castle,Joss Mowforth,4,"Really good tour and beautiful castle and surrounding countryside. Unfortunately there were no tours in English (all Czech), but they did provide a brochure in English with the details. Worth a visit."
Křivoklát Castle,Belén Ross Morrey Pérez,5,"It was really nice for a one day trip, they offered English tour guides that even though it was not perfect, it was worth it. The views are beautiful and there is a mystic all around."
Křivoklát Castle,Kimberly Pace,5,"An absolutely beautiful castle! A little bit of a hike on a cobblestone road to the entrance, but not bad.  There are a few Café's inside the castle."
Tykocin Castle,Milica J.,4,"Lovely but we didn't go inside because they had no information in English and they only have a guide who speaks Polish. In order to find out anything about the castle, you need to book a guide in advice. It's a shame, it is a beautiful castle."
Tykocin Castle,Wojciech Sawicki,5,"Dining and/or staying overnight at a partially reconstructed castle is an amazingly unique experience in itself. Now top it off with superb food and an amazing location by a picturesque river and a wondrous historical town, and you get something truly magical."
Tykocin Castle,Trixzy,4,"I often come back to this little Jewish town each year, but this year I decided to invest a little more time and enjoy the castle, I wouldn't recommend paying for the tour, as you don't get much out of it, but the castle itself is in a pretty location and the restaurant inside has some lovely Polish traditional dishes."
Tykocin Castle,Aston Mastonsecond,2,"Bad experience. The tours are only in Polish, we drove two hours just to hear that... You also cannot take a look inside without guide, absurd.. Didn't try the food. Plenty of parking."
Tykocin Castle,Lukasz Macht,4,The castle is entirely rebuilt to its XVIth century glory from ruins. Normally this would make it a fake sight but the 45min tour discussing the history and political background more than makes up for it. It's also a nice subtle reminder that this used to be the center of Polish/Lithuanian kingdom of old.
Castle of Sárospatak,Panna Mama,3,"The place is amazing, however the lady at the reception, selling the ticket was unkind and rude. Every time someone asked her something she was extremely annoyed. There was an entrance fee and still the toilet cost extra money. So many tourists and visitors, I would work on making the place more professional with English guidance."
Castle of Sárospatak,Ákos Molnár,5,"You can enter the castle itself, which is nice, but if you want to visit more of it, you have to buy the ticket. There are several options, with some of them being for example two for one, or three for one... The guide is usually in Hungarian, but I guess if you want it in other languages, you can ask beforehand. You can also walk in the huge park and there is a large playground for the kids. There are many restaurants and parking space around the castle, and the area around the castle is also beautiful and calm."
Castle of Sárospatak,Waiyee Lai,3,Nice walk and view outside.  We visited on a Monday and it didn't open. Not even the WC.
Castle of Sárospatak,Bettina Csikvari,5,"Nice place. It's a pitty that the tower needs another ticket, not full included. Thanks for the teachers' discount ticket."
Castle of Sárospatak,Lundahem,4,"A nice castle at the top oin the middle of Sarospatak. A great view of Bodrog and the city from the top. The entrence is a bit too expensive, but you can see a lot for free as well."
Červený Kameň Castle,Anton Göransson,5,"This is a castle with a lot of history. You can walk the grounds for free but I recommend you get a tour (they have in english as well and the guide spoke great english) which is the only way to get in to the castle. You have to pay 2 euro to take photographs. The english tour is not very often so check that before going, we happened to get very lucky with our timing. Also we went here using the public transport system from Bratislava which was quite a hassle and not something I recommend during the hot summer. I think renting a car is the easiest way to get here. The tour was very interesting and is something I highly recommend to learn more about Slovak history and how life was at the castle. There was also beautiful paintings and portraits, there was a collection of Piranesi paintings that were exquisite"
Červený Kameň Castle,Allan Behrens,4,"Interesting castle and location. A small selection of furniture and artwork exhibits too, although some English translation on the guided tour would have been useful. Missed the tour of the cellars as the (disinterested) tour guide didn't (or wouldnt?) accommodate the more leisurely walkers. Shame that."
Červený Kameň Castle,Murat Dambali,5,One of the best castles I’ve seen. I recommend to take the big tour and see all the more than 20 beautiful decorated rooms and the different Interieur from all over the world. Don’t forget to visit the cellar with its huge halls and the very deep well. If you visit it on the first Sunday in the month entry is for free. Huge parking for free.
Červený Kameň Castle,Andrius M,4,"Interesting museum, very well maintained. We bought a tour in English but were put in Slovakian speaking group. So had to read papers and didn’t understand anything the guide was saying. And the museum sells family tickets, but the group that we had to go with was full of “Karens” shushing other kids. Let kids be freaking kids."
Červený Kameň Castle,Toni Todorovski,5,Beautiful forest with red rocks caves. Cute palace too nearby.
Valdštejn Castle,Victoria Antaresna,4,"It's a very nice place to visit. The disappointing thing though (that is not specified and worth at least being mentioned) -  the tickets are for guided (in Czech) and non-guided visits. The price for a visit without a guide (Vstupné bez průvodce ) - 90,- Kč for an adult. We did not speak Czech, so did not have reasons to join the guided groups (though difference was really minor, less than 1Eur  - Vstupné s průvodcem plné 110,- Kč) 5 minutes later we found 2 sets of exhibitions (2 floors out of 4 available) were allowed for visiting by JUST guided groups. The guide we met explained ""it's true and may be ""unfair"", but they still have a room for improvements"". So, if you have plans to visit all available exhibitions of the castle, buy the ticket with a guidance in czech language. Also, enjoy the views)"
Valdštejn Castle,Randy Law,5,"The gate was closed when I went there, so I could only see the castle from the bridge. (Opened weekends only until the start of May). Trails here are easy to follow."
Valdštejn Castle,Peter Knight,5,"The new exhibition of the costumes for famous Czech fairytales is great. The young girl that was hosting the tour was fantastic, happy informative and entertaining for the small kids we were with. Definitely worth a visit"
Valdštejn Castle,Peter,4,Nice Castel with very interestin story abou it 🙂
Valdštejn Castle,Jan Petr,5,"Nice castle, excellent guide, real treat. Highly recommended 👍🏻"
SDH Nelahozeves,Aleš Pitucha,5,Good bunch of people.
Houska castle,Zuzana Loudal,5,Very interesting place. Nice visit.
Houska castle,Giel Mosselmans,3,"""The gateway to Hell"" The tour was not in English, because the guide couldn't speak very good English. You can ask the guide for a map with information about tour, but it felt like we where missing out on the details. It was not bad, but a little bit disappointing. They could have done more with the place."
Houska castle,Nigel Kelly,5,I have been waiting 5 years to see this place and it didn't disappoint. It's easy to see why so many legends and mysteries surround the place. Would have been cool to spend the night.
Houska castle,Lukas,1,Ok
Houska castle,Dmitry Lovermann,5,"Old castle, actually without a great history, BUT they made guide based on the fairy tale, that there’s gate to hell in the middle of the inner courtyard. Very impressive and atmosphere, can only recommend to  singles, pairs and families."
Predjama Castle,Jake Garbelotti,5,Great experience exploring on our own. The cave rooms at the top were a nice temperature. Short walk from the parking lot too (just a small incline)
Predjama Castle,Marek Šolc,5,"A beautiful interesting castle, a nice place to relax, also suitable for families with children, mobile devices are also available for interpretation in different languages ​​when scanning a QR code. Beautiful views of the surroundings, there is also a souvenir shop."
Predjama Castle,David Mellor,5,Fascinating castle built into a cave. Take your time and enjoy the commentary on the clever self guiding tour. There are quite a few steps but the view from the top inside the cave/Castle is terrific.
Predjama Castle,Ron Huber,5,Very unique castle built into a cave. Audio tour gives interesting details as you walk through the castle. Easy to do the tour at your own pace
Predjama Castle,Jeroen Verhaart,5,Amazing castle build in the rocks. Just imagine the work it should have been in the 13th century. The guided audio tour is awesome and gives you a lot of information. Book this together with the cave and your day is complete.
Orlík Castle,Zuzana Parrette,5,"Been here numerous times. It's close to where I stay with family.  The castle only has one tour. It's been the same tour for 20+ years. I love going back none the less. Beautiful views over the Vltava river. Gardens and you can even get on a boat tour here. You can Go from Orlík to Zvíkov on the boat. They do one way or round trips.  A couple of cafes here at Orlík as well. And the village has great restaurants and cafe bars as well. I highly recommend this area. It is one of my favorites. Also, this is one of the Castles you can not take pics inside."
Orlík Castle,Dimitrios Grantas,5,Great castle!! And only like one hour from Prague. But I would say it's better to go somewhere from the opposite side so you can have the view of the castle or rent a boat. 🙂
Orlík Castle,Holly,4,"Quiet town, and very beautiful riverside views! Just an hour’s drive from Prague, it is ideal place for hiking and visiting with family or friends on weekends."
Orlík Castle,Incongruent Malopropic Parrot,5,"I really liked the castle and surrounding area. The tour inside the castle is guided only, which I'm not a fan of but I was told our guide was very good and made some nice jokes too. (I don't speak Czech, but of course information sheets are given out in other languages that explain the rooms, you just miss out on the jokes).  No photos allowed inside the castle, but there are beautifully styled rooms, large collection of shotguns and deer antlers. Even one that was shot by Franz Ferdinand!"
Orlík Castle,M T,5,Super gorgeous and a relaxing place. 100% recommended to go as there is really not much beautiful in Czech Republic.
Andrássy Palace (Wahrmann Castle),AEndrU,4,"I have trouble with this place because I have no idea what to evaluate. Basically it is just a big park with an empty palace and a water tower in the middle of it. No museum or anything, during the communism everything was stolen, but even in it current state, the place still has it's charm, though it saw better days. When I was there, there was a Catholic child camp inside, and as the only visitor I felt as an alien among regulars. But the entrance fee is only symbolic, and the scenery is really nice. If you want to rest in a quiet park with such scenery, this may be a good choice for you."
Andrássy Palace (Wahrmann Castle),Balint Regius,5,Beautiful castle. Absolutely worth to visit.
Andrássy Palace (Wahrmann Castle),DoomZealot,5,Beautiful piece of history. It's a wonderful location to have a wedding and the nature trails behind the castle are so fun to walk. The castle kitchen was a lot of fun to volunteer in during my time on campus. Overall amazing place to visit.
Andrássy Palace (Wahrmann Castle),Angela Ulrich,5,The castle is a real hidden gem on the edge of this small village. The size of it's grounds are truly wonderous with huge foresty areas several lakes and medows. The castle itself is a beautiful representatation of the 19th century's magnificence. Definitely worth visiting even just for a relaxing afternoon stroll in the park or for a weekend getaway spending a couple of nights in the renovated accomodation quarters in the castle.
Andrássy Palace (Wahrmann Castle),Jake Asmah,5,It's an awesome castle well maintained with a great school operating there. The lake is beautiful and peaceful.
Zámek v Nových Hradech jižní Čechy,Stanislav Kosos,4,"It's a shame that you can't see the interiors, only the garden"
Zámek v Nových Hradech jižní Čechy,Ladislav Karel,5,👌👌
Zámek v Nových Hradech jižní Čechy,Petr Manda,4,Nice and quiet place.
Gruyères Castle,Rick,5,"Nice ""castle"". Lots of history behind it. Interior decorations are recently done with items from the time period. If one looks at the post cards on display in one of the rooms, the decor was quite different even 100 years ago. Nice how there are privately owned residences in the town outside the ""castle"". Enjoyed the tour, although quite pricey."
Gruyères Castle,Paul,4,"Visited the medieval village of Gruyères in early August 2023.... again... I haven't been back since visiting in January 2015 with my Filipino friends. Obviously the big difference was the sun and the temperature, from -10 to ÷25, made a huge difference ;-)  Nice little village, very touristy, visited the twisted Geiger museum, Geiger definitely had a screw loose. Talented but not fully sane. Didn't visit the actual Castle, I'd already spent enough.  Had a decent spaghetti bolognaise in one of the restaurants, not too expensive for Switzerland."
Gruyères Castle,Najeeb Abdullah,5,We came to explore Gruyere Village and we decided to first visit the castle. along the way and at the top floor there were amazing views of the local area. The inside of the castle was also very interesting and it was cool to see the different rooms decorated so elegantly. It was overall a good introduction to the history of the region. Definitely a highlight of our trip to experience this.
Gruyères Castle,Chris Le Tissier,5,"Been before about 15 years ago. Flower garden nice. Ramparts good, just watch your head.  Inside nicely arranged. Plenty to see. English placards. If arriving by train take the bus. Walking to the Ville is a killer walk anytime   worse in heat."
Gruyères Castle,Matthew Kunzler,5,"Great experience. When most think of Gruyères, cheese is the first thing that comes to mind, but the chateau here is historic, detailed, and fair priced. It's a smaller chateau, but loaded with history. The views are stunning and the tour itself takes about an hour. It's self guided, but each room has a detailed description of what the room was used for. Highly recommend!"
Schloss Ort,Andrei Marginean,5,"A beautiful location which brings a breath of life to those admiring it. The roads are clean, very well maintained, organized and loved by the community. There are local stores and tourist attractions nearby and lodgements. Local internet stores are nearby for tourists who need a card loaded with Gbs."
Schloss Ort,Backpacker_ Hiker,4,"Nice spot to watch the views from! I came on a stormy day which was very cool! Didn't go inside the castle as already heard that there wasn't much to see. But again, a nice place to see the views from."
Schloss Ort,Shikha Singh,5,very beautiful. The weather was perfect for us. It was sunny and looks amazing with the view of snow mountain at the side of the castle. As per local guide it is the most romantic place to marry for local people of vienna. It is worth to visit such a serene place.
Schloss Ort,Amber Webb,4,We made a 40 minute stop here on our way to Hallstatt. Beautiful views of the lake and Alps. If you're out this way it's definitely worth a stop!
Schloss Ort,Luke L'sk,5,This is one of the scenic locations on the tour package that we stopped by for about half an hour. Beautiful castle by the lake with a nice wooden bridge that leads to it. The tour guide mentioned that many Austrian Brides would love to take their wedding photos at this location due to the fairy-tale Scenic setup.  There seems to be a restaurant at the location so you may order a drink or food and sit by the lake to enjoy the scenery.  If the weather allows you may see the mountain in the shape of a person's face facing upward. I was advised that the majority of the time that face is blocked by the cloud so you may need to be very lucky to see the whole face.
SLOVENSKÉ BANSKÉ MÚZEUM,Jorge Clementez,4,enjoying it!
SLOVENSKÉ BANSKÉ MÚZEUM,Angelika Hanusz,5,"A very nice place, I would like to come back here again. Beautiful little town with nice people."
SLOVENSKÉ BANSKÉ MÚZEUM,Peter Novák,5,A guided tour of the mining museum is possible.
Bory Castle,Ruby Rejoso,5,"It is one the most beautiful places I've ever visited here at Székesfehérvár. Although it has a 2500 entrance for those who haven't had a discount it was worth it by the way. The place has so many paintings that will bring you back to the wonderful decade before.  The scenery above the castle 🏰 was amazing and mesmerized me because the overlooking and houses, plantation and trees around there. I'm happy to be there and planning to come back soon🥰"
Bory Castle,NYPTBLUE ONE,5,Magical! The grounds and building are both interesting and beautiful. Great location for taking photos or a photo shoot. Hard to believe it’s only 100 years old since the experience transports you to much older times.  Highly recommend visiting. You can easily meander about and lose track of time.  The benches in the courtyard and throughout the grounds are a nice feature.
Bory Castle,Luqman Hasan,5,"A very nice attraction out of Budapest. The castle is worth to visit. A short train ride around 45-50 minutes from Budapest. The city itself is very nice. Once you reach the train station, buy the bus ticket from the machine for discounted price or you can also buy from the driver using cash for 400 forints per ticket. Take any bus that’s going to the castle such as bus number 32 and the bus stop is just outside the train station. The castle is pretty nice, beautifully designed and some interesting stuff to see inside the castle. Recommended if you want to see something outside of Budapest."
Bory Castle,Jozsef Nagy,5,Beautiful castle free parking outside and nice cafe across the road
Bory Castle,Weronika Orłowska,5,Very interesting and entertaining place. Not only art lovers will have fun here :)
Zámecká černá kuchyně,Zdenka Sardova,2,"The service is very pleasant, the garden is nice, the food is average, not corresponding to the higher price. Salad unseasoned, salmon without lemon, meat, potatoes, iceberg lettuce swimming in sauce... it would be half the price and not 170 CZK for a small salad with salmon without pastry."
Zámecká černá kuchyně,Aleš Šilhánek,4,Pleasant environment
Smetana's Litomyšl,Denys Kuznietsov,5,"This street is pretty much everything about Litomysl. And it's beautiful. Cafes, restaurants and shops at your service."
Smetana's Litomyšl,David Štegner,5,"It depends on your taste. If you choose performance that you like, atmosphere is unforgettable. :-)"
Smetana's Litomyšl,Attila Kurucz Dr.,4,Beautiful smart city with interesting historical places.
Smetana's Litomyšl,Petr Novak,4,B-)
Smetana's Litomyšl,Harsh Parmar,5,Peaceful place
Ambras Castle Innsbruck,Illy,5,"I strongly suggest you to go there on foot if you like hiking because you're going through such a nice natural environment as you can see from the pictures. However, don't forget to get something to drink before starting going there because your body will need to be kept hydrated since it's a bit steep and might be tiring for many. But still the view when you reach on the top is breathtaking! It's definitely worth seeing. You can also enjoy the garden area for free. Entrance fee is necessary only for the castle 🏰 So, you can consider going there for a nice weekend picnic."
Ambras Castle Innsbruck,Vijaylakshmi v n,5,"The castle is beautiful and has a lot of historical artefacts including paintings. I would recommend the audio guide for families with small kids. The castle grounds are huge and provide beautiful views of the alps. The grounds are very nice for hiking. Walking down the mountain and across the bridge at the end of the garden is a small cave in the rock which is interesting for kids. There are peacocks in the gardens which were also a great attraction. We arrived at the castle at around 10.00am which was perfect, it was very busy after noon time."
Ambras Castle Innsbruck,Dennis Gane,5,"Walking around the grounds and touring inside the Schloss itself is a great way to spend a leisurely afternoon or maybe even a little longer. If you have an interest in art and old weaponry, they have it. They also have a lovely little restaurant on site. The Weiner schnitzel and fries were great with a beer."
Ambras Castle Innsbruck,Rosie Free,5,"Don't miss this if you're visiting Innsbruck! We took the C bus from the old town, it didn't take long at all and was simple to find. Beautiful frozen grounds in winter, and breathtaking rooms inside. The exhibit of art and wonders had some of the most interesting treasures I'd ever seen, we really did not expect it. Worth the 12 Euros definitely."
Ambras Castle Innsbruck,Ibrahim Hossain,4,"If you come to visit Innsbruck, you shouldn't miss to visit this place. I didn't enter the main palace, but the outside scenario and small waterfall enough to like the place."
Zamek Firlejów,Юрій Тис,4,"In fact, it is even better than in Kazimierz. A more interesting exhibition."
Zamek Firlejów,Paweł Halicki,5,"One could say a classic Polish castle in terms of its state of preservation. What is worth seeing here is definitely the cloisters, which have 3 levels. The view from the top is phenomenal, you can see the Vistula. A small historical exhibition is also located within the castle. In addition, within the entire complex there is also a picturesque park with a manor house and a granary."
Zamek Firlejów,rino,5,I recommend it as one of the attractions in the Lublin region
Zamek Firlejów,Michał Kurowski,4,"The castle looks great from the outside, unfortunately, due to storms, some areas are closed until further notice. The price is reasonable, the price also includes admission to the eighteenth-century manor house. A view of the Vistula, and when you follow the path along the cliff there is a vantage point from which you can see Kazimierz Dolny."
Zamek Firlejów,Sebastian “bastian” Gie,5,Beautiful castle. Lots of sightseeing. Affordable price. Possibility to buy souvenirs. Views not rated!!! I recommend !!!
The Konopiste Castle,Rishabh Jain,5,It’s 30 mins drive from prague. Big ample parking for 60czk whole day. Very nice walk along the lake.
The Konopiste Castle,Raissa Denise De Austria,5,The place is really good for a day trip. Good place to discover history and how it changed. To know what happened to them and how beautiful where the armours. There are restaurant near. Big garden to wall around and even feed some animals. Its 30mins walk to city center to take transportation back to Prague. Great walk in the nature!
The Konopiste Castle,Diamantis Kyprianou,4,"There is train that can get you up to the castle it cost around 2,5 euro and needs around 8-10 min...you need to book a tour guy to get in the castle"
The Konopiste Castle,Daniel Čupec,4,Huge and fantastic gun collection from 15-16 cenceries. Amazing hunting collection. I was just missing time for detailed Couse.
The Konopiste Castle,Yuliia Kurasova,5,"We did not get to the castle territory itself, Sunday is a day off. It is very beautiful around, you can walk for several hours enjoying the views.  Also, on the territory there is a playground with deer and an aviary with a bear."
Krzyżtopór Castle,Markus Hautala,4,"Amazing place to visit, it would be 5 stars if it had more information about the castles history in English. The opening times are really good usually museums close around 17.00 to 18.00 but this one is closes at 20.00. The visit took us a little over 2 hours There is lot to see and I would recommend visiting the castleruins"
Krzyżtopór Castle,Artur Derlacinski,5,"Best castle ruins I've visited in a long time, 5 marked trails to take you around the castle. Beautiful scenery and historic location is definitely my cup of tea!"
Krzyżtopór Castle,Filip Soszyński,4,"Quite an impressive castle, in ruin, but well preserved. Many accesses to various areas. Audio guide available. Recommend to have a look if you're nearby."
Krzyżtopór Castle,Emilia Pe,5,"Such a beautiful place to visit. Hidden gem, totally worth it visiting."
Krzyżtopór Castle,Ma Szilvi,5,"Great little caste to walk around and have some souvenirs and nice coffee in the cafeteria. 13 zloty is the normal ticket for adults. Worth to be outside and have walk around the castle, nice place nothing extremely special worth to stop."
Gasthaus zu Schloss Hellbrunn,Sofia Boneva,5,"Great place at the heart of the palace. Definitely make a reservation in advance because you get there and have a very beautifully prepared table. We were there for breakfast. I had the porridge and the yogurt with fruits and they were both delicious. I also had the fruit tea and I liked it. I tried the croissant and it was fresh, warm, and tasty. The service was a bit slow and that is why, they gave us the croissant for free. Overall, a great experience."
Gasthaus zu Schloss Hellbrunn,Gal Abramovitz,5,"Because this restaurant's location is so good, I honestly had low expectations - they'll succeed anyways, right?  But we were so fortunate to find this place with the most welcoming staff, great food - with mention-worthy desserts - and very reasonable prices.  Highly recommended."
Gasthaus zu Schloss Hellbrunn,Jon Bock,3,"Food was mediocre at best and overpriced, waiter was nice and friendly and location was great to be in the grounds."
Gasthaus zu Schloss Hellbrunn,Fernanda Mejia,5,Great atmosphere and breakfast with a view. Friendly service. Open on bank holidays
Gasthaus zu Schloss Hellbrunn,maryam albuainain,5,"We loved what we ordered, but we LOVED our server Julie ❤️ great restaurant"
Hotel Gourmet,Jiri Matysek,3,There is a nice terrace in the back of the restaurant. Most of the dishes we had were too salty. The kitchen effort didn’t matched the name of the place.
Hotel Gourmet,Pavol Varjan,5,Super 🙏🤩
Hotel Gourmet,Leonhard R.,1,We waited 1 1/2 hours for our Food and the waitress wasn't friendly either. After the 1 1/2 hours of waiting i got a completly rare steak.
Hotel Gourmet,Bohumír Bednář,5,"I can rate my first stay in this pleasant hotel very positively due to the pleasant staff and all available services in this great location right in front of the Horšovský Týn castle and chateau. For myself, I can warmly recommend this stay here or just a visit to the restaurant with its own brewery of several grades of local beers 🛏️♥️😋🍽️🍻."
Hotel Gourmet,Petr Hop,2,"We were only here for lunch. And we won't be back. To call this hotel Gourmet is quite bold. The underseasoned pork tenderloin with mushroom sauce was cold, and the minced meat in a lox covered with a strange tomato puree (according to the description, it was BBQ sauce) was also not good. The beer was great. We were given dessert and coffee as an apology. I don't want them to apologize to me, I want to eat well! The service was fine."
Maiden stone,Jurij Tič,3,There is a bit of a walk (18 minutes) to get to the ruins which is quite steep. There is also an admission fee which should be taken into account
Maiden stone,Ermi Mirek,5,"A medieval castle ruin in a beautiful and romantic place. You can reach the ruin on a moderately difficult road in 20-25 minutes from the parking lot. It is less recommended with baby carriage and toddler. You need to pay a minimum admission fee, but the experience of finally arriving there worth the money. It worth to visit!"
Maiden stone,"Dr. Michael Kohlberger, BSc MSc",4,"There is a small entry fee of around 50 crowns, and while the ruin isn't that spectacular, the area around it is really nice (when you're on the way to the ruin, walk in the other direction, toward/along the river, to see a cute old overgrown house).  Well worth a visit!"
Maiden stone,Joeri Arkink,3,"In september very quiet place with nice views. If you go, I recommend reading about the stories/tales in the folder you get at the entrance. It provides some depth!"
Maiden stone,Payal Bhuptani,3,The walk was beautiful from the trivon car park to the ruins. But nothing great about the ruins especially if you have traveled to hampi in India or to siem reap in Cambodia
Grad Kamen,Jian Chen,5,Discovered this castle by chance on our last day in Slovenia. I found it much better than the over-commercialized castle in Ljubljana. It brought me back in time. You can explore most part of it and not be bothered by too many tourists.
Grad Kamen,Phil Wolf,5,"Amazing 800 year old Castle with some minor renovations for access. The oldest part of the castle is fenced off for renovations, but the majority of the castle and grounds can be explored. If time allows, take the hiking path from the back of the tower to a prehistoric cave and nice views into the valley."
Grad Kamen,Lars Haverkort,4,Nice calm place to visit. Not very busy like the other castles. However treat it like an abandoned ruin not a full on castle.  It's free to visit.
Grad Kamen,Oskar Vovčak,5,Great hike and a good experience. Beautiful views and just amazing architecture.
Grad Kamen,Jakub Olejniczak,5,Great place near Bled for a short trip. Free entrance. Free Parking in front on the street :)
Gyula castle,Laszlo Elekes,5,"We visited the castle with our 11 and 9 year old kids, they absolutely loved it, and so did us. We paid about 38 EUR for 2 adults and 2 kids, but the tickets included visits for the Andrássy castle too. I say it's a fair price. The castle is completely restaured, there is even a real blacksmith shop on site, where you can buy for about 3 EUR a lucky horseshoe with your name on it."
Gyula castle,Markus Reiman,5,"Very interesting place to see. At least on sunday afternoon there was not much people and you might roam around by yourself, had plenty of time and space to see exhibitions and admire surroundings."
Gyula castle,Dorina Guran,5,A real beautiful place to visit...but all the history is written in hungary...and all the guides talk in Hungarian...
Gyula castle,M.Sameh Ismail,5,Interesting castle. Do not forget you visit the tower to have a wonderful view of the city
Gyula castle,Adi Samson,5,"Very nice experience at Gyula, worth to visit. The castle is very well maintaned, old objects available for sightseeing. Very nice panorama, 360 degree on Gyula. A hologram explains an event in the citadel history. Nearby there is a nice park and also the Gyula baths."
Veveří Castle,Nick Ivanov (William von Bock),4,"I took a simple visit, no guided tour. The area of ​​the castle, namely the courtyards are relatively large. It was interesting to walk around its territory, take pictures and look at the area."
Veveří Castle,Henk Jacob de Bruin,4,"Very nice castle complex to visit.We did a tour, the kind guide had a lot of information, which was for 'aliens' only available on hand outsm but the buidling itself is interresting enough. The cafe 'Winston?' was also very nice, with kind waiters."
Veveří Castle,Tran Nhu,4,This place is wonderful during spring. You can use public transportation from the city centre to reach the castle by boat or bus. I recommend you could get there by boat! It is a good experience on the trip ship
Veveří Castle,Debbie Walker,5,Lovely  castle worth taking the boat to to enhance the experience. Note entry is CASH only. Winston is good for a refreshing drink. Well worth a visit.
Veveří Castle,David Koblizek,5,Great spot even for a family visit. 50CZK entry fee. Considering how devastated this place was it is a miracle where it is now. You can drive all along the dam and park under the castle walls or you can walk the trail on the opposite side. It takes about one hour from the Sokolské koupaliště. Worthy visiting!
Castle of Regec,Zezima,4,The castle is easily accessible by hiking through the forest from the car park below. A very nice path leads up. The forest would be quiet and airy if there were no cars. The castle is being rebuilt and the views are magnificent. There are few information signs. Worth a visit.
Castle of Regec,Zsofia Vitanyi,5,"Great historic castle. Lovely walk in the forest to the castle which you can make as long or short as you wish. There are several places to park cars along the way. Do not recommend for very small children (under 4-5?) as some of the walkways in the castle seem very dangerous for little people. Although we managed our visit with two kids but was on high alert all the while we were there. The walk up and down was lovely and have learned some fun and interesting historical facts. The view from the top is amazing, well worth it!"
Castle of Regec,Dale Pitulski,5,"There is something about a castle in it's ruined state. We have visited many of the Hungarian castles, many of which have been renovated/rebuilt. We enjoy those as well, but seeing remains can be enchanting. We are American citizens so we have no history like that of Europe, so seeing a structure that is hundreds of years old is amazing. Couple that to a spectacular setting in the mountains on a fall/foggy day and this is one of favorites.  Be warned! We love to walk and hike, but if you have multiple small children like us, you do not have to park at the first parking lot, although Google Maps tells you you must walk the rest of the way. There are two additional parking lots, halfway and full way to the castle."
Castle of Regec,Janos Turk,5,Great destination for a family weekend. It is 30 min walk from the car park up to the mountain. The entry was 2000 HUF for 1 adult and 2 children. Drones banned. Great landscape.
Castle of Regec,Oliver Pelák,5,"A nice walk to castle if you park your car under the hill. The castle is nicely restored, there is also small museum, where the guide will show you how people lived in past. Also tickets are cheap, around 5 Euro per adult. You can buy souvenirs and coffe in the shop near it."
Schattenburg,Namhee Joo,5,"The best museum i've been so far as a heritage researcher, well-preserved historic monument and the reading materials to understand each relics and paintings were so helpful! And also I'm very grateful to Frau Vedder, her kind and knowledgeable explanations made my day! thank you, Feldkirch to conserve the Schattenburg with the care and attention!r"
Schattenburg,Виктория Зайцева,4,"Despite the fact that before that we had visited Liechtenstein and were already tired, we went to see the castle.  Unfortunately, we did not get into the museum itself, because we arrived after 16-00, and at this time in winter the museum is already closed.  But we were able to see the castle courtyard and walk around the neighborhood.  We admired the magnificent view from the observation deck and took a photo of the city from above.  We will definitely come again to visit the museum."
Schattenburg,Samuel Nord,4,"We were at the Ritterstüble and had a coffee, latte Machiatto and a nice time sitting there with not too much people around. If you want something medieval, go for it. Prices are ok and you will enjoy it in a vintage atmosphere with a funny crocodile 🐊 hanging from the roof 🤪"
Schattenburg,Marcel Scholte,4,"From the outside it does not look as a large place, though inside a lot to see and explore in the museum. From the top floor a nice view, which should be marvellous when the weather is cooperating (overcast and drizzle when we visited)."
Schattenburg,Anderson England,5,"A very nice collection of historic artifacts including religious items, furniture and weaponry all displayed in various rooms. A trip to the top of the tower really gave a fantastic view. There is a gift shop and a nice restaurant in the courtyard."
Burg Hardegg,Ondrej Shanel,5,"Castle which you should visit if you love middle age.  Fee is only 7.5€ per adult person. It is not guided tour. You can reach almost any room at the castle - dinning hall, chapel, east tower,  summer and winter kitchen.  There is a huge exhibition about mexican emperor Ferdinand Maxmilian with lot of artifacts.  Toilets are there as well and small working place for ca 10 cars."
Burg Hardegg,Καρελ Μπιαλεκ,5,Beautiful small town and mystery castle on the Rock. Around flow Cristal clear water of Thaya. Wind is play with leaves of trees in forest everywhere around the town. That is valley and magic of that town.
Burg Hardegg,Ken Taylor (KangaAir),5,"Only a 1.5 hr easy drive from Vienna, I highly recommend visiting this region to view the castles historys.  A visit in Autumn will reward visitors with the remarkable colours of nature and delicious Austrian white wine."
Burg Hardegg,CalantheCintra,5,"Amazing walk! 12.5 km of rougher terrain, however, that view is worth it! We followed red."
Burg Hardegg,Martin Bozán,5,Hided gem. Old city and awesome castle on the hill.
Burg Strechau,Christian Marek,4,1400 had a pvt tour of the place nobody else was there at the time. Guide was great castle has been well restored. Really worth going of the highway for. Has a little museum of Steyr car inside as well
Burg Strechau,Gabriella Seye,4,A nice privately owned castle with guided tours. We could exactly reach the last tour and we liked it. The most interesting part for me was the hiding place for Luther's bible! It was awesome!
Burg Strechau,Antonija Perkovic Prpa,5,"Others have said it many times, so i'll just add that the lady that works there is so nice and welcoming. I was late for 10 min, but she waited for me and was really an amazing guide. Love the place and the whole surrounding."
Burg Strechau,Fernando Leal Alvarez,5,Beautiful und quiet place to relax getting a little bit of Austrian history. Incredible Styer cars collection.
Burg Strechau,MARICRIS Schmiedseder,5,Old car models and nice view from top of the Palace Museum.
Castle Kokorin,Sarah Clement,5,"Breathtaking castle and views! Absolutely loved my visit, and would highly recommend it. Nice staff, and a cute little gift shop.  However... it's quite an uphill hike to get here, and is full of many steep staircases, and so you should be in ok shape with ok mobility if you want to come here."
Castle Kokorin,Yash Patel,5,"Such a Nice place for one day Hike How to reach Hrad Kokorin? Take a Bus or Train from Prague to Melnik, Then take a Bus from Melnik to Village Kokorin 474 Bus No. You can also take Breakfast or coffee Break in Village Kokorin. From there 30-40 mins Hike You will reach Hrad Kokorin They have 120 CZK TICKET to visit the Hrad."
Castle Kokorin,petr jakubicek,5,"Nice, in early 20. Century rebuild castle. Near the castle is on-site parking, but I would recommend to leave the car in Kokořín village, it's comfortable 20-30 min. walk from there."
Castle Kokorin,Randy Law,5,"Parking is 100 Kc. Walk up a steep set of stairs, and there is the castle. Can partially walk around it, but full access to tower and building is 120 Kc. Open every day, despite what Google says."
Castle Kokorin,Timea McCullough,5,"Very nice castle which is in good condition. You can pay 100 czech koruna fee for the tour. They don't do it in English but they have printed text you can read about the castle. You can climb up on the top of the tower, it is a gorgeous view around the forest. They have birds like ravens and falcons which you can take pictures with."
Grad Podsreda / Podsreda Castle,RudeCatStudio Cieszyn,5,Full of culture and rich Slovenian history in a magnificent scenery
Grad Podsreda / Podsreda Castle,Matej Grgecic,5,"Nice service, a lot of interesting things to see inside the castle."
Grad Podsreda / Podsreda Castle,Katja Altintas,5,Very nice castle. Giving good entertainment for kids and adults by buying extra activity Treasure hunt. Recommending.
Grad Podsreda / Podsreda Castle,diana marceta,5,"Very nice and restored castle. Beautiful interior, many exhibitions are shown. Visiting the castle is also very interesting for children, as it offers a treasure hunt. Audio guidance around the castle is enabled and in this way you can find out a lot of information. There is also a bar in the castle. Beautiful surroundings."
Grad Podsreda / Podsreda Castle,Konstantin G,5,"Very nice castle, placed on hills. There is just amazing road to there that running through a forest. But pay attention that it closes pretty early."
Castle of Tarasp,Aymeric Larcher,1,"Vers beautiful castle but visit only in German. Even if the guide speaks in English and Frensh, he did not make any effort for us and did not inform us before buying the (expensive) tickets. Not the image of Switzerland we want to bring back home..."
Castle of Tarasp,Alina L.,5,It is a very nice castle where medieval and modern art coexist in a very harmonic way. It offers an awesome view on the valley too. I recommend to book the guided tour as this is the only way to visit it. Inside the castle is not allowed to take pictures.
Castle of Tarasp,Alexandre Anguelov,5,"Imposing, very well preserved and maintained castle, private property now. Visits only twice per day, with a group; entrance fee."
Castle of Tarasp,Luisa Prado,4,We expected something old with lots of antique objects. But in 2016 the castle was bought by a Swiss artist so you can also see modern art in there. It’s not just an old castle
Castle of Tarasp,Til Zwanzig,5,"A new attraction at the Castle Tarasp: the first Sunset House of Not Vital in Europe - After Agadez, Niger (2006) and Brazil Paranà do Mamori, Amazon (2016 ) - now 2018 also in the lower engadine: amazing !"
Bolczów Castle,Natalia Navrotska,5,"Nice wild castle, you have to hike. Some routes are tough so carefully choose, you can use fire roads, then you can go there with a stroller. Amazing fresh air and nature."
Bolczów Castle,Egor Bushykhin,5,"Castle ruins with a character! The road to them is quite hard - 30 minutes uphill, but it's worth that. Castle was built at the top of the rock, there are scenic views and medieval atmosphere."
Bolczów Castle,Łukasz Stachnik,5,"Great place to visit. I was there at late  spring/early summer and trees were in bloom. Remarkable castle situated in the woods. Rocks were used as a fortifications. When you climb up to the highest point you may see a great part of Rudawy Janowickie mountain range, Klodzko lowland and Karkonosze Mts. Easy access from bus/train station in Janowice Wielkie."
Bolczów Castle,Sławek instagram: (Psychosomasis),5,I really like to visit this place from time to time.. really nice place for taking pics and views for hills and forests!
Bolczów Castle,Pawel Galewski,5,Very mysterious castle ruins... Long journey by foot through forest to uncharted regions of it to uncover beautiful Bolczòw Castle ruins... And there is pretty scary tunnel going under the castle...
Rožmberk Castle,Karina Adriana,5,"I will not talk about the beauty of the uphill view. It speaks for itself. There are regular tours taking place, but only in Czech. So, I understood nothing. It costs like 8€ cca, and it lasts for approximately 45 minutes. You get a file with the texts in the desired language, and that gives you an idea about what it is spoken about. The language barrier is not tragic at all. The tour is worth it anyway. Coffee and some drinks or ice cream are available from the shop."
Rožmberk Castle,Jan Pochobradský,5,We didn’t go im but the hike was nice and short-ish😅  Beautiful and well maintained Castle🏰👍  The whole atmosphere is way better than in Krumlov
Rožmberk Castle,Adrian Niculae,5,Amazing view. And the area is fantastic.
Rožmberk Castle,Buster Got it,5,"Rozmberk *Rosenberg* Castle and the surrounding village was aweseome. The layout feels a lot like Cesky Krumlov exceot the castle (Lokjs completely different). Only 30 minutes by bus but make sure to check what time is the last bus return to Cesky Krumlov or Ceske Budejovice. Bus stop in the center, just across the bridge from the castle, only 7 or 8 minute walk. Return bus stop is directly across from the arrival bus stop."
Rožmberk Castle,David Lancic,5,Nicely equipped castle with a good view over the town.
Aggstein Castle,adir adler,5,"Definitely worth the visit (I arrived with my bike!). Well maintained, variety of spots to view the magnificent views. Before entering the castle, don't miss the view point right to the entrance."
Aggstein Castle,Zoltán Nagy,5,"Nice ruins with nice views, somehow renovated pathway for the visitors."
Aggstein Castle,Gerald Primeßnig,5,"Wonderful castle located in the Wachau. It is reachable by foot via a one hour trail from the bottom of the hill or by car with which you can drive up to the very entrance. There are a few large rocks besides the castle which can be used to climb up (the bigger ones should only be used by experienced climbers). The view there is quite nice, however the best view towards the valley is only possible from the castle itself. I personally would recommend to hike up if you do not fear a few moderately steep pieces along the way, with hiking sticks it should be easier. Total time up and down is about 1,5-2 hours depending on your fitness and amount of breaks. The way is well described and easy to find. If you are around of course you should check out Stift Melk and the city below :) come for the castle, stay for the apricots (and there are lots 😁)"
Aggstein Castle,Theresa Hadley,5,Beautiful castle with amazing views. Very well taken care of.
Aggstein Castle,Samuli Rantala,5,Definitely worth visiting. Pretty large castle complex with amazing views. Good parking  area too.
Turňa Castle,Erik Urban (ErosKE),5,"We made a trip to Turniansky Castle again after 1 year and after very bad weather, it turned out ☀️☀️☀️ Under the castle Parkovisko and the tourist path between the gardens up the hill, about half way you can help the construction workers by carrying sand or stone. The castle was being worked on and progress could be seen👍, a very pleasant lady who is at the castle as a coordinator, took good care of us and talked to us👍. The ascent to the castle is not very difficult, I definitely recommend it to families with children."
Turňa Castle,Pavol Poprocký,5,"Turnian castle and the climb to it is perfect for a typical Sunday walk. At first glance, it seems to you that it is ""nothing much"", but the views that you can see from there on the valleys on all sides grab your heart and you go to see what a beautiful country, we Slovaks, have been inhabiting for centuries. 😊 The activists who repair and tidy up the castle in their free time are definitely worth mentioning. I bow down to them, because at the expense of their own comfort and family, they are doing something that will remain here, even if we are not here, for future generations. On behalf of everyone who cares about our cultural monuments, I thank them - OZ Castrum Thorna. 👏"
Turňa Castle,Gabriel Kerekeš,5,"From the parking lot, which is right next to the main road, the ascent to the castle does not take much time, and if you have energy to spare, you can also do something useful for the castle and bring out some sand for the workers (volunteers) who are trying to restore the castle."
Turňa Castle,Alojz Gazdík,5,"The trip to the castle with the children there and back from the parking lot in front of the restaurant took about an hour and a quarter, a distance of about 3.6 km (total). A very nice trip."
Turňa Castle,Slávek Šáfa,5,"Beautiful place with a nice view. On the way up, it is worth taking ""down"" some prepared material for the conservation of this ruin...minimal help to those who are trying to do it - many thanks to them! 👍"
Grodziec Castle,Naomi,5,This was a lot of fun. I really enjoy the old castles that let you explore every nook and cranny on your own. There’s something a lot more personal to be let alone to explore at whim. A lot of great views from the rooftops and fun camera angles. A must stop if you’re in the area. We drove over and hour to get here and it was totally worth it!
Grodziec Castle,Daniel T,5,Beautiful castle with a great view of the surrounding fields and small towns. They have several events with characters in typical costumes of the medieval time.
Grodziec Castle,P J,5,Nice to visit Grodziec Castle. Every year getting better. Before was free access to inside of castle and paid for visiting rooms and inside. Now you need pay straight on the door before you get in.
Grodziec Castle,Maksym V,5,"This is the best castle we have ever seen! It is highly underrated and relatively unknown. We stumbled upon this place by chance and were unsure whether to visit or not. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we decided to go. The castle has a truly breathtaking effect and offers a unique experience. There were not many visitors, allowing us to explore all parts of the castle. We highly recommend visiting this hidden gem!'"
Grodziec Castle,Pan Sosen,5,"Beautiful historic place, where you can take a tour with a tour guide or walk around all by yourself. Plecy of place to take a walk, take pictures or spend the afternoon in a quiet and lovely atmosphere, surrounded by lots of greens."
Zamek Dunajec w Niedzicy,Diana Petrachescu,5,"Very nice place to spend a relaxing day with family and friends. There is a parking place at the entrance in the park which I recommend, as it is much cheaper and bigger than the ones near the castle. You can rent bikes to explore the area. You will find also bikes with child chair or with  carriage for 2 kids. There are some places to eat or drink something and many small shops for souvenirs. A small beach is available with sunbeds (payment) or free of charge if you choose to stay on the sand/grass directly. There were also kids playing in the lake so I suppose that it has a part that is not deep and has a smooth entrance (we didn't try it) We had a ship tour on the lake, that we really liked."
Zamek Dunajec w Niedzicy,Baluma1,5,"Try to arrive early during summer holidays, so you don't have the Castle full , we were almost alone at 10am. It's a lovely place, we received a written guide in  Slovak, which was enough. For sure it's worth a visit with plenty of other activities for the whole day in the area."
Zamek Dunajec w Niedzicy,Vasyl Zeliuk,4,"Interesting place for one-time visit, nice views of the surroundings, couple of good spots for taking photos, however guided tours might have been better, avoiding nonsense touristic ""legends"", but adding more historical facts and deep dives about the castle and the territories nearby. We took a tour at 18:00, which included a guided tour around the castle and a visit of carriage museum. When tour ends at around 7pm, the carriage museum is already closed, so you literally pay for nothing. Worth mentioning that tour itself was overcrowded with around 40 people in it, very inconvenient...."
Zamek Dunajec w Niedzicy,Two little penguins on road,5,"Castle itself is really beautiful. Parking is right in from of the castle entrance and it cost 20 PLN (we were allowed to pay with euro - 5€ .. actually we were able to pay in euros in the whole area, they are probably used to it, because the castle is near Poland-Slovakia border) The castle tour was without a guide - we were going by ourself, only with a paper with printed information. After the tour we visited a nearby dam. There was a beautiful sight not only on Niedzica, but also on Czorsztyn castle."
Zamek Dunajec w Niedzicy,Magda L,5,"Beautiful place to visit, very picturesque. Castlecitself is relatively  small but well maintained and tour guide is worth taking (free of charge) nearby you can take a boat around the Dunajec Lake or jus relax on nearby beach"
Schloss Schönbühel,Ian Morton,4,A great schloss in very good condition. it  offers a welcome in to the scenic Wachau Valley.
Schloss Schönbühel,Anthony Chan,5,Castle from outside on the river cruise looks amazing
Schloss Schönbühel,Ihor Zeiger,5,"It is closed to public, being a private residence, but from outside it looks amazing."
Schloss Schönbühel,Victoria Rabtsevich,5,"There are very beautiful castle, nice town and locals. Definitely recommend to visit!"
Schloss Schönbühel,S JG,5,Beautiful castle but only can see from outside
Bouzov Castle,Nick Ivanov (William von Bock),5,A wonderful castle. Beautiful both outside and inside. There are very professional guides. Inside is very interesting and there are many different exhibits. Separated took a tour of the castle and climbed the tower. The views are stunning.
Bouzov Castle,Adrián Sepúlveda Zambrano,5,"Great Castle to visit. They had a guide that tells you everything but in Czech. However, they give you a guide with the translation of the tours speech in English. You have to be lucky because I had the tour in the middle of the rain but it was magical. Great place to visit. As a advice, come early and bring your water."
Bouzov Castle,Ádám Veres,5,"Very nice castle with unique architecture. The history of the castle is also very fascinating. The guide was very informative (it was sin Czech, English you have to book in advance). There are guided tours every 15-20 minutes on a busy day."
Bouzov Castle,Ion Bodnari,5,"Definitively a castle that should be visited! Located in a pictoresque area, the castle it self is very beautiful! We had a small problem with english language, but anyway, this castle is a must!"
Bouzov Castle,ajcook80,4,Great castle to visit on the weekend. Had fun with the family. It's also a pet friendly park.
The State Chateau of Hluboká,Iain Brookes,5,"An interesting place. One can see how much money was thrown at this house to convert it into a pseudo castle. The library room was amazing. I would recommend parking on the main road and getting a taxi up to the castle itself as it is a very steep climb up the road. The view from the tower was awesome and certainly worth the 245 steps and two heart attacks getting there. The restaurants and ice cream vendors on the castle approaches are well worth a visit. I highly recommend the black cherry ice cream. Apart from being delicious; it also turns your poo black for a couple of days! All in all, a great place to visit!"
The State Chateau of Hluboká,Mob Mobster,4,They could expand the tours because if you want to see more of the interior you need 2 days at least for english so you catch all up… our english speaker was kinda boring with no energy to tell is something new regarding the text in the leaflet you get when tou enter..  But the castle itself is just amazing!
The State Chateau of Hluboká,Carrie Shakespeare,5,"Decent walk up the hill from the carpark, but definitely worth the visit.  We booked a tour and while it was a Czech tour, found the English tour notes very well written and I followed along.  The steps up the top of the tower were good, and view from the top was great.  Can't take photos inside the castle, so I definitely wished I could look back at some of the things I saw."
The State Chateau of Hluboká,Robert Obłój,5,"Hluboka Castle is a very beautiful place to visit surrounded by park, shape of the castle is astonishing and make effect of wow. The entrance is paid and requires tour guide, so if you want to visit castle's interior, check entrance time and language used by tour guide on desired time you want to visit it. Park gives you a take breath and make you relaxed. I truly recommend this place."
The State Chateau of Hluboká,Anastas P,5,"I was with a kid, so we didn't take any guided tour inside the castle. Just climbed the tower and walked in the park around. And it was already worth visiting. Beautiful castle."
Zámek Milotice,Katee Singh,5,Beautiful castle surrounded by gardens ♥️ Love this place 🥰 It's very nice to visit for day trips with or without children. My children loved the ice cream 🍦 😋 which we bought there 🥰
Zámek Milotice,Maya Kučerová,5,I just love this place. The gardens are lovely and then you can have a coffee in the castle café.
Zámek Milotice,Lasse Nielsen,4,A castle worth seeing. You can rent period accurate clothing and have a stroll through the beautiful garden. There is a cafe in the courtyard where you can get ice-cream and grilled meats. There is also an aviary with birds of prey.
Zámek Milotice,Martin Patricny,5,Very nice chateau with interesting historic cafe and also outside seating in the courtyard. Cool stop on a biking trip.
Zámek Milotice,Richard Sámela,5,"Beautiful gardens and chateau. It was a real pleasure to have a walk through the gardens, took some picts and had a great time. To get into gardens cost nothing, it's completely free. To visit the chateau from inside it's around 4 EUR. I think it's worth it for people who like history, old fashion and style."
"MKS ""Karkonosze"" Sporty Zimowe",Darsi Karate,1,There are better clubs to exercise at

Hochosterwitz Castle,Ελένη Φασουλή (Nena Salamina),5,"The 2nd time during summer, weekend this time, I visited the castle and I really enjoyed it and loved it! It's worth visiting but by car or bike. The station is nearby but by feet you will feel exhausted. 😅 I also liked the restaurant that there's in the castle but I would suggest it for a drink rather than food. The castle was great though! Have fun, enjoy and have a power bank with you because you will take a lot of pictures to remember! ❤️"
Hochosterwitz Castle,Małgorzata,5,"Amazing castle! Very well preserved in the unchanged condition, which is a rare thing. Totally worth a longer visit. A walk to the top is much better than the lift for those who can. Otherwise you miss a lot of beautiful sights and gates."
Hochosterwitz Castle,Csipka Linda,3,"You don't get much for the expensive price you pay  Family ticket 45€ plus you need to pay separate for the use of the lift 10€for a return trip pp.  Tiny museum, expensive restaurant but stunning views."
Hochosterwitz Castle,Ruediger Preiss,5,"Such a lovely castle to visit, giving hundreds of sceneries for great photos and kids loved it. Would be nice if there was a musician in the yard to play some ancient music (hurdy-gurdy etc?), surely for the price of the tickets the Khevenhüller family can afford someone at least on the busier days?"
Hochosterwitz Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"A very interesting fortress, which did not have its own permanent garrison, but was built purely to protect the population of the surrounding villages in case of any threat. There is a museum inside, but photography is not allowed. Entrance costs 17 euros if you will walk up. If you want to use the elevator, then an additional 10 euros you are to pay. There is a cafe with a tasty menu and reasonable prices in the courtyard of the fortress. The fortress deserves your kind attention"
Forchtenstein Castle,András Tölgyesi,5,"The castle is a must-visit if you are travelling around in the area. There are information leaflets in every room in four languages.  This castle holds the only full-scale painting of Vlad III. Voivode of Wallachia, also known as Vlad the Impaler (or Dracula in popular culture)."
Forchtenstein Castle,Vanesa Vazharova,5,"A place with beautiful history and one of a kind weapon collection! It is only possible to visit the place as part of a tour during the winter season, and, unfortunately, the English tours do not take place during this season. The staff was very kind, though, and gave us an English booklet including all the details."
Forchtenstein Castle,Bojan Benko,5,"A very nice castle. I liked it a lot. On the hill,  above very beautiful little town. Parking lot is free of charge. There is also a nice Cafe/restaurant on the site.  Museum inside castle is very interesting. There are so many interesting things to see and learn. Staff was more then friendly and polite and very professional and helpful. For every recommendation."
Forchtenstein Castle,Ginny Marksl,4,".. did this with a tour guide and it was worth it.. Daniel, the guide, did a great job...quite like how displays are well maintained... in spite of the fog, found myself to have enjoyed the visit"
Forchtenstein Castle,Colin Downie,5,"What a surprise this restaurant was, the location at night was spectacular, so we can only imagine how nice the view would be through the day. The food was top class and the the decor was a very high standard and off the beaten track."
Schloss Hof,Marek Prudovič,5,"Beautifull palace near Vienna with one of the most astonishing gardens I've ever saw. The palace itself is mostly classic museum with only few rooms traditionally furnished, but the gardens itself are worth the trip. Great fountains and architecture, vivid flowers and as a bonus, you can spot many sqirells in at least one part of the garden, where you can also sit and relax in the shadows of the trees."
Schloss Hof,Stefan Frisch,4,"Beautiful castle. Entrance fee a little strangely high and strangely priced (21€ entrance +4€ only for a guide). The guide was excellent and we really enjoyed the guided tour. However as it was officially the family tour, I didn’t see it was especially family friendly and parts of the pottery als is not especially interesting.  But the castle and the gardens and buildings around are definitely worth a visit!"
Schloss Hof,Pavol Rajzak,5,"Very nice park and castle, everything is in a good condition. Lots of things to see including animals and gardens. Place is great for kids with lots of activities. It is worth spending there whole day since it is very large."
Schloss Hof,Claudiu Preda (Historian & Tour Guide),5,"An absolute must, that will take your entire day. 21€ combo ticket offers discounts to other castles in this area. Super helpful curators and employee."
Schloss Hof,Marek Hrnčiarik,5,"Very nice polished experience, big gardens with some animals and plenty of activities to do during the events. Plates, clothes, some furniture and stuff inside. Very few rooms available to the public though. Fair prices for whole area."
Pieskowa Skala Castle,Margarita Z,5,"Interesting castle with good exhibits! Beautiful exhibitions. A lot of interesting things. A one little minus, you can not buy tickets online and long lines. it's not easy to stand in line in the heat."
Pieskowa Skala Castle,Иван Затевахин,5,"a wonderful place in the middle of a dense forest is located one of the most impregnable castles of the Middle Ages, the problem with transport on weekends and in separate rooms you need to buy tickets. but the luxurious nature will more than pay off. from the castle one of the best views in Poland. definitely recommend"
Pieskowa Skala Castle,Marcin Kaminski,5,"The Castle Museum is part of the holdings of the Wawel Castle Museum but is located within the Ojców National Park. Accessible by car or by hiking trails within the park. The Castle has exhibits covering the historical changes in style of European art , history of the Castle, old Polish culture, English painting and in summer of 2023 a temporary exhibit of science-fantasy painting. Pretty garden, best viewed from the Castle Museum rather than paying extra to enter the garden itself. My kids also liked the fact that to get a tourist coin of the Castle you had to mint it yourself using a hammer and blank metal pieces. Parking is located below the Castle and it's a bit of a hike up to the Castle entrance. Parking is paid and although it has card readers these seemed to lock up when we were there. Bring small Polish change to make things easier."
Pieskowa Skala Castle,Frantisek K,3,Mixed feelings - its like someone just decided to build disneyland here. So its clean and nice but far from authentic.
Pieskowa Skala Castle,Leo Glag,4,Beautiful castle. Very charming. But there was no guided tour in English. A lot of exhibition space.
Niepołomice Castle,Andrew 1971,3,"Pleasant venue, easily reached by public transport from Kraków but the collection is mediocre, only about 10 pictures represent the Young Poland art movement, despite the gallery name. Better to visit the much superior collection in Rzeszow."
Niepołomice Castle,MarcZ,5,"Very nice food,With friendly staffs plus friendly Dog 🐶 definitely we will come back!"
Niepołomice Castle,Helen Towers,5,Beautiful buildings in a quiet town off the beaten tourist path. Very relaxed meal in the castle courtyard after a visit to the museum. The  park and gardens were great too.
Niepołomice Castle,christoph klinger,1,"Very unfriendly hosts!  We just wanted to ask for a room for one night so my driver stopped to let me get out to the reception and then wanted to drive further to a parkinglot to wait for my return . A guy came out from the hotel yelling at my driver really angry to leave and after he went running after me yelling at me we should get away now. He was really angry and unfriendly even i asked for a room.  No room for you, go away now! Now!  Il never comeback of course! Worst behaviour i ever encountered, for just asking for a room.  One star is too much!"
Niepołomice Castle,Kārlis Krūze,5,Beautiful renaissance castle. Very nicely renovated. Has beautiful polish artist Painting exhibition. The animal exhibition is really good quality. Possible to spend the half a day. With a walk trough the city center and spending some time in the park near castle.
Teutonic Castle in Radzyn Chełmiński,Paweł Stasienko,5,"Great place where you can experience everything first hand. The castle is held in an ""eternal ruin"" concept, so it would not be rebuild, but only  shielded from the elements. You can touch the weapons (swords, hatchets etc) as well as helms, shields and torture equipment. You can enter with pets."
Teutonic Castle in Radzyn Chełmiński,Mikolaj Krol,5,Great place to visit and people at reception are nice and friendly and you can see that they like and enjoy their job! Quite a bit too see there! And there great views from the top of the castle! Will for sure come back ! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Teutonic Castle in Radzyn Chełmiński,Markus Hautala,5,"Nice old medival castle, that was built by teutonic knights. The castle has torture chamber, a room where you can try medival armor etc., a lot of stairs and two towers where you can go to the top, all though going otside on the top of the tower is hard for tall peapole becouse of the narrow window sized holes."
Teutonic Castle in Radzyn Chełmiński,Hans de Keijzer,5,In its glory days this must have been an incredible castle: the ruins are impressive but give only a glimpse of what this castle must have been like. Amazing size for a building of early 13th century.
Teutonic Castle in Radzyn Chełmiński,Marek Bartosik,4,"Remains of old Teutonic castle. Small and cozy, good for short stop."
The Donjon,C T,5,The view of the tower is great but I do not recommend visiting in winter because of the wind. Be careful while climbing the tower because some part of the ceiling is lower and the step size is uneven. There is information about the tower and dungeon but only in Polish. The entrance costs 10 zł for adults. It is easy to buy tickets from the ticket machine.
The Donjon,Lukáš Karlíček,5,"Very nice Viewegh ot whole city of Lublin. Attention: There are high stops on the way up. The entrance costs 10zł regular, 8zł reduced."
The Donjon,Christian Eilers,4,"The tower offers a great view of the old town. Its winding stairs are quite uneven, making it more physically challenging than other similar towers. It also was used as a prison some time ago, and the rooms at its core offer some information and history, though only in Polish."
The Donjon,Klaus Wanderer,1,"Closed for renovations during my visit although it was included in the Lublin card offer, turns out that that card is a complete rip-off"
The Donjon,borzans,4,"View from the top is fascinating! However, the exhibitions inside are only in Polish and this is not communicated when one buys a ticket."
Rihemberk,Dorothy Kowalsky,4,I can only give 4 stars because I couldn't get in. They really should change the hours on Google maps. And I didn't read other review where only weekends are mentioned. It is impressive from the outside though
Rihemberk,Alena,5,"Amazing place to visit!!! magnificent castle, view for the whole valley! I wish all the best for people bringing castle back to life!"
Rihemberk,Janja Viher,5,"Very nice castle, 6 eur entrance, well preserved main tower, you can walk up to the top"
Rihemberk,Tjaša Koderman,5,The most underrated castle in Slovenia!
Rihemberk,Jana R,5,"Wonderful guy at the entrance tells you short story and you may wander around, price for 1 person is 5 euro. Worth to visit. It has lovely views and you learn a lot about this place."
Zborov Castle,Robert,5,"Zborov Castle is truly a fantastic place. The castle's rich history and stunning architecture make it a must-visit destination. From the moment you step foot inside, you are transported to a bygone era filled with intrigue and charm. The well-preserved walls, towers, and courtyards create a captivating atmosphere that immerses you in the castle's story. The panoramic views from the castle's ramparts are simply breathtaking, offering a picturesque vista of the surrounding countryside. The knowledgeable guides provide fascinating insights into the castle's past, adding depth to the overall experience. Whether you are a history enthusiast, architecture lover, or simply seeking a unique adventure, Zborov Castle is a place that will leave you awe-inspired and enchanted."
Zborov Castle,Kamil Widłak,5,"Very interesting site, it is not that promoted but really worth seeing. Currently there is reconstruction taking place. No fee required but there is a possibility to leave a tip for visiting."
Zborov Castle,Blaylock,5,"Entrance is free but you can donate to support the restoration of the castle. The work is in progress but it  is not a problem for sightseeing. There are two paths up, one short and steep and one easier but longer. I strongly advise against taking the steep path down. The view is gorgeous."
Zborov Castle,Peter Loubert,4,"Wonderful place to visit, but it requires a pretty good hike to reach from the parking area. It's undergoing preservation and restoration, but has a long way to go. Not safe  in many areas, so proceed at your own risk."
Zborov Castle,Kaloyan Vasilev,5,Really good place. The view is amazing! You need to walk 30 minutes but have to visit this please if you are in the area
Žovnek Castle,Damir Habuš,5,Easy trail to the Castle. Beautiful nature and nice view from the Old Town.  Quiet and great for clearing your mind.
Žovnek Castle,Henri Kuusisto,4,"Beautiful castle and easy access,  10 min forest walk from Parking place. Under renovation but allowed to visit"
Žovnek Castle,N.,5,Nice castle located on top of a small hill which offers an amazing view of the surroundings. It is free of charge but if you wantyou can leave a small tip at the entrance. The castle is a light 10 min walk from the parking (gravel road). The exhibition is open only on sundays so keep that in mind.
Žovnek Castle,Marko Ličina,5,"Have been at least 10 years since my last visit here,the castle has been greatly restored to its primal form."
Žovnek Castle,Klemen Pust,4,"A small hike hike through nature, to reach this small castle. No entrance fee. Just voluntary donations intended for further Castle restoration."
Grad Snežnik,Lia Dekker,5,"This is such a nice little castle. Beautiful on the outside and very well taken care of on the inside. I had somewhat of a private tour since I was the only one and the girl great. Her English was great and she knew so much about the castle. Any question I had about the castle or one of the items…all answered in a split second. It was a great tour! Thank you so much (took the tour on monday 10th of July 2023 at 13.00…don’t remember her name anymore, but if you read this: you were great!)"
Grad Snežnik,Paul Heller,5,"Beautiful castle located essentially in the middle of nowhere. It's in great shape, fresh looking paint and new roof. Free parking on site. It's a few euro to enter into the castle, however I chose not to. You can walk around the castle on a nice path. Highly recommend. About 1 hour from LJ or 35 minutes from Postojna."
Grad Snežnik,Sara Emajli,5,The castle is absolutely beautiful and so is the surrounding park. The staff is kind and very helpful. A must see! All info available on the official website.
Grad Snežnik,Tomaž Jančič,5,Beautiful fully restored castle which statted as a small medieval fort but was later built up and redesigned. It's final look and style was done during the renesanse period. Thete is also a huge park area around the castle perfect for relaxation.
Grad Snežnik,Beno Saradzic,5,"Most romantic medieval castle in Slovenia, the Snow Castle. It's as pretty as it sounds. Don't miss the visit."
Castle Strečno,Michal Grach,5,Very nice castle with professional guides and beautiful views on all the nature and mountains arouns. Really worth to visit.
Castle Strečno,lenka berankova,5,"Beautiful castle with guide only entrance. Paid parking available under the castle, only about 10min walk to the entrance."
Castle Strečno,Dinh Tuan,5,"The Strečno Castle is a reconstructed ruin of a medieval castle of an irregular plan located in northern Slovakia, 12 km east of Žilina.  The castle stands on a 103-metre-high (338 ft) calcite cliff above the international road E50 and village Strečno. Along with the Old castle constitutes a significant landscape landmark of the Upper Váh region.  The medieval Strečno Castle was built relatively late, because it was only at the turn of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The exact date of its construction is unknown, the first recorded mention of the stone castle is from 1316. It took over the role of the Varin Castle, which was only 3 km away, and the task of its crew was to collect tolls on the ford by Váh. The first mention of this function comes from 1358.  Initially, the castle was a small site, limited to a square tower of the function of a bergfried and a residential building with a vaulted ground floor on the north-eastern side of a small courtyard, surrounded by a polygonal wall. Its dimensions were only 18 x 22 meters, and the entrance led from the south through a bridge over the ditch. The tower had dimensions of 8×8 meters and was accessible only through the ogival portal from the level of the second floor. It guarded the gate and protected a deeper placed residential building. There was also a rainwater tank, cut in the rock nearby. Still in the first half of the fourteenth century, a small outer ward was formed on the southern side.  At the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century, a new ring of walls reinforced with three semicircular towers was added to the west and south, more easily accessible sides, and the entrance was elongated further south by the building of the southern foregate. The new perimeter of the walls created on the west side a very narrow zwinger area. The residential buildings of the upper castle were then expanded by a new eastern palace and a two-winged building in the southern courtyard (the former outer ward). The chapel was raised and crowned with a net vault, and the palace’s façades were varied with late-gothic windows and bay windows. Probably then, in the area of the western ward, a 88 meters deep well was carved.  A little later, because at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, new buildings were erected between the north tower and the chapel, topped with three arcades. Further north, on the rocky promontory was erected a small tower, probably of a guard and warning function, connected to the main complex by a curtain of the wall. The southern foregate was also extended once again.  Strečno Castle remained in ruin for a long time, from late seventeenth century until the 1970s, when extensive reconstruction works took place between 1978 and 1993, so that they could make it available to the public in 1995. After reconstruction, there are expositions of the Váh region regional museum. Today the castle belongs to the national cultural heritage of the Slovak republic.  Admission: - Adults €6 - Students, children (7 to 15 years), senior over 60 years €3 - Children up to 6 years free  * Some photos courtesy of Internet. Thanks!"
Castle Strečno,Igor Pasko,4,Its a very nice castle. The lady that was guiding us was very informative and funny. It was a pleasant trip. there to many stairs. From the parking lot there are two ways to get to the castle. One is very steep with a lot of stairs and the second one is longer but more pleasant for people with bad knees. There is a great view form the top of the castle.
Castle Strečno,Adrian Peplak,5,"We haven't been inside, but we managed to see it from the outside. The view from the top is amazing and the castle itself looks really good.  Below the castle is a parking lot for 3 Euro."
Plavecky Castle,Crimson Blue,5,"Exploring the castle is like going through a quest, the place is really, really large. I spent about an hour there walking the pathways 🤗and the views are sooo beautiful!  There's a free parking. A lot of spaces, though I arrived somewhere around noon. Smth like 20-30 mins walk to the castle, 👍"
Plavecky Castle,Nicola Volturale,5,"No tickets, no guides, just straight up 30 mins of walk in the woods to visit the ruins of a castle! What more could you ask for?! The view is breathtaking, but beware because there are no safety rails, no warning signs, you might want to keep your kids on a leash to avoid them from falling into the Carpathian forests down below. There's a good place to eat some cake in the village down below, so be sure to pay a visit!"
Plavecky Castle,Deepak Budhraja,5,Beautiful trial walk to the top of the hill abandoned castle. Takes about 30 mins. Great views from the top.
Plavecky Castle,Lotte Meeuse,5,"Amazing ruins. Lovely hike in which you have the option to choose an easier or more difficult hike. I’d say about 20/25 minutes up and the same to go down. Very beautiful at sunset, but be careful because you’ll have to walk back through the forest in the dark."
Plavecky Castle,Alfonz Liska,5,"Fantastic views from castle, easy to access about 30min from parking. Access was free of charge on beautiful sunny day. It is good for families, even with small kids. On top it can be dangerous because it is bit high so careful about your kids."
"Musée de la vigne,du vin, de l'étiquette",Alejandro Montiel,4,"If you travel from the train station in Aigle, you are better off walking about 20 minutes until you reach the castle (The museum is there too). This museum will be enjoyed by everybody who visits (obviously the wine aficionados will likely spend more time here). There are lots of videos and cool stuff to check out!"
"Musée de la vigne,du vin, de l'étiquette",Holly Rendle,4,Interesting and beautiful!  Only thing missing is TASTING the wines!  This wouod be an ideal spot to taste the different heirloom grape and wine varieties.
"Musée de la vigne,du vin, de l'étiquette",ma vision des choses le guide et voyageur,4,"Good welcome, interesting museum on the methods and production of wine. A film, museum on several floors. There is a magnificent view from the ramparts. A few parking spaces in front of the castle."
"Musée de la vigne,du vin, de l'étiquette",Hugues Baud,5,"This is an interesting museum presenting the past of viticulture and the present, to visit absolutely."
"Musée de la vigne,du vin, de l'étiquette",Marion Neshkka,5,Superb castle and well done for the Christmas entertainment!
Diósgyőr Castle,Fijinote J,1,"Quite concrete fake, maybe in the past was nice, now its not renovation, but building of completely new castle like Disneyland. Such a shame…"
Diósgyőr Castle,Marko Bošković,5,The catle with its expositions are in very good conditions offering a lot of facts and subjects well organized in rooms which are every of them focusing on some specific part of activity. Nice peace of history. Very professional staff. Highly recommend.
Diósgyőr Castle,thvs86,5,"If you're in the Miskolc area this is definitely worth a visit. It's one of the nicest castles I've seen in Hungary; this medieval castle was a favourite holiday residence of Hungarian kings and queens. The castle was renovated between April 2012 and 2014 and instead of a historic castle ruin, visitors can now visit an old, remodeled castle. The castle features a special feature of informal cognition; the visitors can experience the atmosphere of the medieval castle freely, trying all of the things. In addition to the interactive content, reenactors dressed in timeless outfits, as well as spaces on the ground floor that showcase everyday life, contribute to the atmosphere. As a quick reference for the origin of the name: Dió means walnut, referring to the abundant walnut trees in the area. Győr is an archaic version of the word gyűrű, meaning ""ring"". It probably refers to the rounded shape of the first castle erected on the hill. The first castle was probably built in the 12th century, but destroyed during the Mongol invasion. The castle that stands today was most likely erected in the times of King Béla IV, in the 13th century. The castle had its prime during the reign of Louis I (Louis the Great). In 1364 the nearby town Miskolc was annexed to the Diósgyőr estate. Diósgyőr lost some of its importance when the political union between Hungary and Poland ended. In 1596, the Ottomans occupied the area; Diósgyőr remained under Turkish occupation, ruled by the Pasha of Eger until 1687, when this part of the country was freed from Turkish rule. By this time the castle lost all of its military importance."
Diósgyőr Castle,Ade Krownwell,5,"Modern renovations, looks medieval and also modern and stable. The inside rooms are brilliant and from the rooftop all the city is visible. Interactive screens with diverse games inside, including a photography maker machine that sends you a postcard with your personal photo on e-mail on the spot. Worth the ticket!"
Diósgyőr Castle,jason penn,5,Beautiful castle with an incredible feel. What made this worth the visit was the professional tour guide who played the part in traditional Knight costume. He delivered a knowledgeable brief passionately and answered questions thoroughly. Great day out! Looking forward to visiting when the jousting and other entertainment is on in the future!
Topoľčany castle,Pali Varga,4,"For quite an unknown castle ruin, this one is pretty surprising - on the outside, and also on the inside ... I mean the courtyard part, with open-air amphitheater sort of sitting arrangement (with the surrounding walls, one could easily mistake this for a Roman theater). Missing tourist facilities might be a bummer for some, a welcome aspect (solitude, quiet) for the others. This one asks no money of you. I was just disappointed that the reconstructed tower - the most characteristic part of the castle - is locked and inaccessible. The views into the surrounding country are nice even from the walls. Btw, very short and easy ascend uphill from the parking lot, on a slightly destructed field road with annoying stones."
Topoľčany castle,Evan Galvin,4,"First of all, it's free, but it's not manned meaning no tour guides. You have some great views of the countryside. Unfortunately you can't go up the tower."
Topoľčany castle,Tom Rychetský,3,"A well-preserved ruin. However, without any description and anything that an ordinary tourist would appreciate."
Topoľčany castle,Peter Valach,5,"Parking is near the castle, just a 10 minute walk away. The castle ruin seems to have been renovated rather intensely in the recent years. Not many other castle ruins offer the same level of safety features and restoration of walls. The inner yard seems to be used also for theatre or other performances with the amphitheatre-like wooden seating. The castles tower was not accessible during our visit in September 2019. That was probably the only minor disappointment. There are plentiful places around the ruin from where you can view the surrounding area. For photographers there's plenty of elevated places to shoot from and the many windows of the main wall open up for different lighting games throughout the day."
Topoľčany castle,J R,4,Lovely to walk around the ruins with beautiful views. What a shame there's nowhere to relax with a refreshing cup of coffee or something else.
Castle Jasenov,Soňa Kundrátová,5,The castle ruins are under reconstruction. Some parts are already looking really nice. The view from castle is beautiful if u catch good weather. Safety railings are being placed   around and on the upper part of the walk path. Sadly the yellow mark from park  space is pretty steep. So hard to climb for ppl with less stamina (like myself 😅) or people with disabilities. On the path are some benches for rest but I would recommend taking it slow. Hope in the future the path will be reconstructed for better access. Worthy to visit for sure 👍 Along the path up to the castle is also a kids playground.
Castle Jasenov,adrian ross,5,Really lovely castle that has clearly had extensive renovations in the past but it has been done sympathetically. Nice walk and nice views.
Castle Jasenov,Joonas Böckler,5,Very easy to find. You can take a little hike to top of the hill and for the reward enjoy the castle ruins.
Castle Jasenov,Kevin Richter,5,"This is very beautiful old castle. It is currently being repaired, but there is still a lot to see. The view from the castle is astonishing. There are three possible ways to the castle you can take. Red, blue  and yellow. Red one is the longest and leads through the meadow following by forestry road. Blue one is the shortest but most difficult through the forest and yellow one is gravel road made probably by builders repairing the castle. It is also most suitable for most tourists."
Castle Jasenov,Tomas Hnat,5,One of the must visit places around humenne. Nice view at whole city. I like that this castle is in renewing process. For mtb enduro riders there are few lines down which are pleasure to ride.
Šomoška Castle,Diána Farkas,5,"A pretty well kept place that has been renovated partly. It has the ruin fleur still, but you also have the chance to look out. Oddly this castle belongs to Slovakia. In reality, you cross the border by visiting it - and the way leads to it from Hungary.  The castle of Salgó is also nearby. They are twinning 🙃"
Šomoška Castle,Péter Kajtár,5,"We ended up here accidentally as we aimed for an another castle nearby, but we didn't regret anything. Surprisingly clean and well maintained castle ruin with spectacular view. People who can access in different season or see a sunset from here are lucky."
Šomoška Castle,Thomas William Walsh,5,"Nice place, the road up is okay, but lots of stairs. The place is partially renovated. Nice view to the land and to Salgó fortress."
Šomoška Castle,Maria Dzunkova,5,"Beautiful ruined castle. It is very special, because it built from the basalt stones. Nice views. The hike through the forest is very pleasant"
Šomoška Castle,Poenaru Alexandru,4,"It's a cute little castle, really nice to visit. The only reason I give it only 4 stars, is that I would love seeing it restored a little more."
Frýdštejn Castle,Geoffrey Poynter,5,Great castle. Fabulous views from the tower. Well worth a visit
Frýdštejn Castle,Rémi Martin,5,Unexpectedly beautiful. I recommend climbing to the top
Frýdštejn Castle,Glusia K,5,"Nice place - remnants of a stone castle - a few areas of various use by the original inhabitants. Great view from the top. Impressive walking up & down the steps/ladder. But...beware of the parking lot - a VERY impolite person selling tickets - if you buy for an hour or two, he will very impolitely shout at you to leave a few minutes before the hour ends, even if you just stop to set navigation and though the parking is almost empty! Awful treatment!"
Frýdštejn Castle,Michaela Čermáková,5,Nice place to visit.
Frýdštejn Castle,Paweł Safian,5,Decent pile of rubble!
Zamek Ogrodzieniec,Manishi cally,5,"Excellent place to visit with family. It's a place for every age group. Kids can enjoy science park, rides, and miniature park. Adults can experience the beauty of medieval castle.  There are lots of souvenir shops from where you can buy beautiful things. You can also enjoy food and ice cream.  5/5 marks for this beautiful place."
Zamek Ogrodzieniec,Margarita Z,5,Nice place but very touristy. Missing a bit of the exhibition of the past life. It would be perfect to show more daily life of our past. But the awesome remains of a castle
Zamek Ogrodzieniec,Waving Tree Farm,5,"I arrived a bit before 10 on Sunday morning. It was pretty quiet which was nice. The setting is really nice. The nature is just as good as the castle! The castle is huge and the views are amazing. There's tons of stuff to do for kids aside from visiting the castle. And, there are plenty of vendors if you want food/ drinks or souvenirs.  By the time I left it was getting quite busy. If crowds aren't your thing then go early."
Zamek Ogrodzieniec,Mark Daws,4,"An exceptional castle that has been renovated and made safe for scaling. The views are amazing. There are plenty of dining options around, as well as beers, as you enter on the left. I would recommend the local ale Jura."
Zamek Ogrodzieniec,Lasura,5,"A very impressive castle, the cliff formations and monumental architecture are absolutely stunning to behold.  You can pretty much see the whole castle, a path leads through everything though there's quite a bit of climbing up and down.  Renovated and maintained in an interesting, respectful way.  Please please please do stop by here."
Château de Tourbillon,Yuriya,5,"Literally the highlight of sion!! The hike up is fairly short, about 15 minutes max. The views up are spectacular and it's awesome at the top too. The castle ruins have not been restored and has very interesting history. There are guided tours for free with no reservations!!! You just show up and get to learn about the history and layout of the castle. Going on the guided tours allows you to go into rooms and the chapel as well as the bell tower that is closed to the public. THERE ARE ORIGINAL WALL PAINTINGS DATING BACK TO 14TH AND 15TH CENTURY THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE TOUR!!! Our tour guide was literally the best and it was the best tour I've experienced in my entire life. Please do the tour if given the chance!!"
Château de Tourbillon,Simon Thall,5,"Cool place to visit during a visit in Sion. We did not particitate in any of the free (?) Walking tours, but a lot was possible to see on our own. Nice view of the city and especially the church on the other big mountain in the city.  The walk is kinda steep, so good physics and water on a hot day is required.  Went there by car and parked it in a nearby parking garage near a walking street."
Château de Tourbillon,Karsten S,5,"Great tour of the chapel and tower. Very knowledgeable and charming guide. Accommodating, able to explain in many languages, very beautiful place and good view of the surrounding landscape. Learned a lot about the history of the place and archeological techniques. Would recommend!"
Château de Tourbillon,Tom De Blende,5,"I had visited Tourbillon Castle 2-3 decades ago, but never did the guided tour. What a mistake! We walked up to the castle via Valère Basilica. I had read in several reviews that the tour was very much worth it. And that was certainly the case!  Cèdric the guide turned out to be very knowledgeable and charming, and spoke French in a way that we as non-native speakers could easily understand his stories. Over the years we have done numerous guided tours, but this one is without any doubt one of the best we ever did.  If you plan on visiting the castle, make sure to check when the tours are planned. You won't regret it!"
Château de Tourbillon,Anna Berza,5,"The hike to the castle takes about 15 to 20 minutes and the view is astonishing. On a clear and sunny day you can see the orchards, the vineyard, the town and the Basilica on the opposite hill. Spring is the ideal season to visit"
Český Šternberk Castle,GG Bk,4,Český Šternberk Castle is a mid-13th-century castle located on the west bank of the Sázava River overlooking the market town of the same name in the central bohemian region of the Czech Republic. Still owned by same family member Today Cesky Sternberg Castle is a residence with a rich historical and architectural heritage. Open to the public It is considered one of the best preserved Gothic bohemian castles.
Český Šternberk Castle,Jesper Ellitsgaard Steffensen,1,Beautiful castle with a great history. Guided tour not in english but only in czech although we got an english description of all rooms. The tourguide spoke way to much.  Castle = 4 stars Tour = 0 stars Overall experience = 1 star
Český Šternberk Castle,Alex Oleksenko,4,"Nice castle, with a cool view, and a place overall to walk around. There is a village in neighborhoods."
Český Šternberk Castle,George Dani,5,A beautiful castle with an interesting story. We where lucky to find a very good and helpful guide. Thank you very much!
Český Šternberk Castle,jay hague,3,Second visit here. Beautiful view of the river and beyond from the wall of the Palace. Nice tour of some of the state rooms. Knowledgeable guide who spoke English although we were on the czech tour and I had a card in English with all the info on each room but the guide asked us if I had any questions. Tour was about an hour so just right. 172 steps inside to climb apparently when me elderly uncle mentioned all the steps inside. Worth a visit if you're close by.
Radomysl Castle,laurence couture gagnon,2,"Really nice location, beautiful scenery and design. The castle itself is well renovated and preserved. However, we stayed for two nights and were extremely disappointed by the food and service. The food served by the hotel restaurant is simple and too expensive. We felt like we were bothering them. The room was not cleaned the second day and we were told by the personal that this was common practice. Special thank you note to Yuliya who was really helpful, professional and hospitable."
Radomysl Castle,distractednine di,4,"Nicely maintained place, there is a park outside and a well kept estate with a hotel and medieval icons museum inside. Everything is beautiful, though the territory is rather small and it's hard to spend more than 2 hours here. A boat can be rent beside the lake."
Radomysl Castle,Denis Sakhno,5,"Great castle. As suggested by other contributors take a blanket and some food with you, you can arrange your own picturesque picnic. Worth visiting the show where they replicate making of paper and printing the way it had been done centuries ago. This show starts at the beginning of each hour, if I'm not mistaken. It took our family of 3 couple hours to enjoy the castle and its premises."
Radomysl Castle,Brett Goldner,5,"Awesome place, a must see!  Best in the Summer or Spring time when the flowers are in full bloom.  Great place for a date also.  Shows a lot of great history of this area and the major trade routes that passed in through here back in the day."
Radomysl Castle,Kevin Steve Lopez,5,"Castle – the Museum of Ukrainian Home Icons. They were painted in XVII-XX centuries. Its exhibition of Christian art objects, named “The Soul of Ukraine”, is the biggest one in Ukraine. Today they are open for visitors of the Museum’s exhibition halls where has been collecting and saving from destruction over 5000 home icons for 15 years.  This collection represents the philosophy of thousand Ukrainian families from different regions of the country audits evolution throughout centuries. But in all times the Ukrainian home icons have been family heirlooms painted for individual spiritual needs of every person in family. Here you can find home Iconostasis /wall of icons/, small travelling icons, Cossack icons, Hutsul folding icons, the icons painted on canvas, casted of metal and carved on wood and also ancient wooden and stone sculptures. Travelers call all museum exhibits as “orphan” icons, thrown out of houses and saved from destruction in the times of aggressive atheism. Some of them were damaged when faith of God was persecuted.  Paper Mill Reviving good traditions of the paper mill of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, the manual production of paper, practiced by Orthodox monks 400 years ago, for further book-publishing, was restored in the Castle. The Castle’s paper production line uses the same equipment that was used in XVII century. The paper made in Radomysl was used for printing “Chasoslov” (The Book of Hours”) – the first book ever published in Kyiv, in 1616.  The Castle’s Landscape Park, little but comfortable and nice. Only here you can see a dozen of unique kinds of iris, bred and granted to the Park by Igor Khorosh, a Ukrainian plant breeder; pink and white water lilies, English roses, magnolias and also a water-nut, Trapa rossica, enlisted into The Red Book. All exhibits are genuine!  Price per person 150 uah Restaurant inside"
Poenari Citadel,Rosemary Flory,5,"Update of July 2023: The path up to Poenari Citadel is STILL closed. There's a notice posted on the road near the entrance to the path, saying it's closed for renovation until 25 October 2023 (see uploaded photo). I understand from the young people working in the hotel there (""Cabana La Cetate"") that there's an electrified fence around the path, keeping people safe from the bears. I suggest you contact the hotel (get their details from the Internet) after October 2023 to check if the path and the citadel are really open again. I give this review 5 stars, because I can't post it without stars."
Poenari Citadel,Jožko,5,Its closed for nex time. Reconstruction began. On the rouad Transfagarskar Route 7C are many NOT DAGEROUS Bear :)
Poenari Citadel,Vix N,4,"It would be 5* if we were able to get up there but as the castle is in renovation till the end of the year we were not able to, even going up to some level was prohibited due to the bears being in the area. Definitely worth the visit judging by what we could see from our position though. Fingers crossed next year we will be able to see it renovated!"
Poenari Citadel,Florian rockstroh,4,lots of stairs up but a nice view.
Poenari Citadel,Ruxandra Lache,4,"Loved the experience. The climb through the forest is a little test of endurance, with 1480 steps. But once up there, it is truly worth it for the view. There is nothing but ruins, nothing commercially overdone, but in my humble opinion, it is beautiful, and you can truly feel like walking into history."
Dadiani Palace Museum,Tamar Kerdzaia,5,"Very interesting palace, I think it’s one of the best in the country. They have nice selection of Icons and historical stuff."
Dadiani Palace Museum,Süeda Nuris,3,Almost noone is speaking English but there is English guide. If you know Russian there is no problems. There is not much thing to see but Napoleon death masks worth the see. Ps: They don't know how to do math be careful how much you paid. Thankfully the price is 1 gel for students and 5 gel for adults.
Dadiani Palace Museum,Lude Veger,4,"Simpele exhibition with a few special items. In addition to that, the facade of the building is very nice. Just as the park that lies in  A tour is recommended as most of the items do no include an English description."
Dadiani Palace Museum,Eremice,4,"Contrary to what some people wrote, it's possible to take photos in the museum. Only videos are prohibited. In this small museum I found interesting to learn about Achille Murat-Napoléon who married Salome Dadiani, born in 1848 in Zugdidi. The library is fascinating, you can see among other things original complete works by J.J Rousseau. On the other side the botanical garden is quite disappointing by its absence of flowerbeds and generally speaking, of landscape design."
Dadiani Palace Museum,Tata Bazgadze,5,"If you are in Zugdidi, you have to see this museum! There are a lot of interesting exhibits, such as old icons and church utensils, furniture, interior items, dishes and decorations of the  dynasty of Mengrelian princess. You can also see the death mask of Napoleon. The museum has beautiful yard."
Massandrovskiy Dvorets,Элеонора Панькина,5,This is a magnificent place with beautiful nature and interesting history.Here you can get a lot of useful information about Russian emperors.
Massandrovskiy Dvorets,高常乐,5,So good
Massandrovskiy Dvorets,Karl 1974,5,"The Massandra Palace is a Châteauesque villa of Emperor Alexander III of Russia in Massandra, at the south coast of Crimea. Construction of the building started in 1881 and was funded by the son of Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, Semyon Mikhailovich who recently returned from the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. The construction of the palace that was initially designed by French architect Étienne Bouchard in the Louis XIII style was soon suspended after the death of Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov.  In 1889 the unfinished palace was bought by the Russian Imperial Domains Agency for Alexander III of Russia. The new owner commissioned his favorite architect Maximilian Messmacher to modernize the villa's design. Although Massandra was listed among imperial residences, no royals ever stayed there over night (rather preferring the neighboring Livadia Palace).  After the October Revolution and before World War II, the residence was used as a government sanatorium ""Proletarian Health"" for people ill with tuberculosis. After World War II it was used as a state cottage (dacha) under the name ""Stalinskaya"".  After the fall of the Soviet Union, Massandra Palace was used as one of the Ukrainian official residences where were signed the Massandra Accords in 1993. In 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the residence was taken over by the Russian Presidential Affairs Administration. A bust of Alexander III was unveiled in front of the villa in 2017."
Massandrovskiy Dvorets,my humps,5,very beautiful little castle.. pitty that not so wide-spreaded as livadiya or vorontsov palace
Massandrovskiy Dvorets,yawutheawu,5,"Very good place to visit, lots of views and flower gardens. check it out if you are nearby!"
Castle Of Van,SoYa TR,5,Such a beautiful Castle. You have to visit! You can see the city site and also on the other side you can see Van lake. It is a little bit hard to find the entrance to the Castle. And also there are two-part divided.
Castle Of Van,Oz MP,5,"Take your time to visit this place if you enjoy history. Is worth the walk to the entire facility. If you wish to do that, be prepare for an easy hike into the mountain across de field. Wear long pants, sport shoes, and if possible long sleeve or get some bug repellant many flying insects in the fields.  Don’t worry they don’t attack but it is sometimes annoying when you look up and see hundreds or when you move your arms quickly and touch them.  I was with short sleeve and no issues what so ever"
Castle Of Van,Ricky K,4,"Nice castle with a great full view of Van and Van Lake. We went when there is snow there, and it's beautiful. However, the way back down can be a little slippery so watch out for your steps.  The castle can be better if the authorities put in more attention to it.  Not much people when we went there in late December.  We hope the local authorities can put more attention to the historic castle such as cleanliness and building new toilets.  All in all, we we enjoyed our visit there and hope to visit there again next time."
Castle Of Van,Pablo Guajardo,3,"It could be an amazing attraction but it is not taken care of, and it is not easy to visit. Even the part where the Xerxes inscription is located is super interesting but there is not even an entrance. There are ancient churches completely ruined that could be restored and exhibited as tourist attraction.  It has great potential but poorly administered."
Castle Of Van,Marwa Al Anis,4,This location from outside looks soo huge & impressive that some people of our group didn't feel good to climb to the top. We had to check the history through some reviews & websites to understand the history of this palace that exists for almost 3 000 years & so many civilizations left traces there.  I hope one day they will be able to restore it and facilitate the access.
Çandarlı Castle,Christina Preston,4,"It was a nice place to visit. There is not a lot to see as it is primarily the exterior walls only.  However, it is interesting to imagine life from inside the walls, and you certainly have beautiful views from the elevated vantage point.  For a free historical experience, well worth the time and effort."
Çandarlı Castle,Sena Tokgoz,4,View and location is amazing. The only thing The municipality should maintain more historical buildings and include them in the city.
Çandarlı Castle,Onur Kagan Gocebe,3,"Sweet Towers Of Çandarlı: If I am not mistaken it is made by Genoese traders in 13th Century. Such a sweet small protecting castle that was protecting the port from pirates back in time. It is unfortunately, generally closed and you can not enter. However is has its own aura. Nice spot to have a souvenir photo at in the front."
Çandarlı Castle,Cosqun Aliyev,5,Such a good historical place. I feel soul of the castle.
Çandarlı Castle,Bilge Cengiz,4,Nice little castle withe a nice view overlooking the whole area!
Vorontsov Palace,Aleksei_K,4,"beautiful castle.  very well preserved.  made of durable stone, it helps to preserve it in its original form.  survived the second world war.  interesting garden.  you can walk for a long time.  it is generally better to go in the morning.  until the main halls are open.  The territory opens very early.  and while there are no tourists to walk in the park and courtyards of the castle.  the tour of the castle is interesting, but if there is a lot of people, it becomes crowded and difficult to either see or take a photo."
Vorontsov Palace,Alexandr Slaboussov,4,"Cool piece of history, another palace on the Crimean peninsula. Crowded with tourists, beach located next to the palace if you want to to swim on the summer hot day. Parking is very limited unfortunately, twisty little roads. Enjoy sight seeing"
Vorontsov Palace,K Michelizzi,5,"Vorontsov Palace is an awesome historic place to visit. The architecture is grand, and the interior is appointment in period antiques. The park and grounds are absolutely beautiful"
Vorontsov Palace,Debug,5,"Great park, great architecture, really different from the other palaces around"
Vorontsov Palace,Koh Yee Chuan,5,"Thanks to the princes whom emptied their lion desire to have all these fantastic 👍 buildings built. While enjoying the breeze and clean water sun-bathing from the brink of Black Sea, my thought flies. Nobody will not likely to care the whereabout now of all those dignitaries any bit, over whelmingly the scare of Covid-19 pandemic was quickly dimmed once 🏰 the magnificent figure of this awsome building structure was just right at their front. 😀"
Rupea Citadel,Jarrod Hunt,4,"Really enjoyed it. Would have been an impressive site in it's heyday. It's only a cheap entry free so can't really complain, but they could do with putting a few artifacts in the rooms, literally 90% of the rooms are dead empty. Definitely worth a visit though, impressive views all around and a nice fortress to explore"
Rupea Citadel,Hem R,5,Beautiful! The drive up to the different archeological sites in the area is delightful. The place is big and has plenty of still standing buildings to go inside and explore.
Rupea Citadel,George (GT),3,"Nice place, with lots of history. Would be nice if you could aquire the audioguide from the ticketing office, to have a guided tour, but unfortunately you can only buy one online, if the signal allows it, after you download a specific app."
Rupea Citadel,Tomas Flegl,5,"Very nice castle, great views. A lot of parking spaces, if you go by it is good place to rest and buy something for drink."
Rupea Citadel,George Bordean,5,Its a beautiful medieval citadel that has a lot of its initial structures still in place. Be careful as its a place filled with lots of energy and it can be hard at times for sensitives
Bodrum Castle,Maria Manolopoulou,5,"It's a beautiful castle with great views and nice selection of items in the exposition. They had a story and it was easy to gain interest in it. It covers a lot of different eras that this castle has been used. The findings were impressive, especially the shipwrecks and everything rescued from them. There are great views to the sea and the port from the castle. And there is also a peacock! There are two canteens and a bathroom in the castle. The ticket is a bit expensive, roughly 15 euros, but I think it's worth it. A very nice place in Bodrum, worth visiting."
Bodrum Castle,Pak-Ming Wan,5,"Excellent museum and castle worth the time to visit. Entry is on the western side of the castle, and the visit itself is well organized to visit all parts of the castle in order. As you walk around the ramparts, admire the view of the sea and town, the artefacts from the sea wrecks, and the inscriptions telling the story of the construction of the castle by the Order of St. John. In summer, the museum rooms have air conditioning to give you some respite and toilets are available during the visit. Some rooms have graffiti from the 1500s ... Amazing."
Bodrum Castle,Dandelion 777,5,"This place is very special, its belongs to a wonder of the ancient world found in modern-day Turkey, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built around 350 BC. Sometimes you can enjoy concerts or some performances in this place. This place is absolutely have to be visited during the day and if there is any nice events also at the evening time."
Bodrum Castle,Pieter Vijgeboom,4,The castle itself is a great experience. It would have been nice if they had weapons like swords and armour. Don’t expect too much from the underwater exhibition:
Bodrum Castle,Yasin O. Yuksel,5,You should definitely see this place when you visit bodrum. It takes about 2 hours to finish the whole museum. You will be able to see artifacts from the old ages taken out of ship wracks from bottom of the ocean. And there is a real life skeleton of one of the princesses.
Antik Kız Kalesi,Alexandru Ioan,4,"The castle is in a permanent state of repair and even though I couldn't get inside it, the guard at the entrance was quite nice and polite and told me something about its history."
Antik Kız Kalesi,Philippe Jeanty,4,"This is an interesting story: some Roman emperor had a beautiful wife but she couldn't get pregnant. Finally after many years she did. And the baby girl turned out very pretty. So some fortune lady look her hand and got so scared and the emperor asked what is happening. So she finally said your daughter will be dead at her 19 birthday from a snake bite!! So the emperor is very scared and doesn't know what to do. Then they decide to build this castle on the sea so no snake can swim to her. In her 19 birthday they make big celebration for her being alive and one of the guest bring a basket of fresh grapes the girl like. And of course no one realized a snake got into the basket and killed her at night... Apparently this is pretty true story!! The location is pretty, a Sandy Beach is right next to it."
Antik Kız Kalesi,Mohammad Welaye,5,Good place clean the see is too Nice
Antik Kız Kalesi,Halil Aksoy,5,Historical places.amazing nice place
Antik Kız Kalesi,Mallu Turkey Diary,5,"Beautiful view of Mediterranean sea, historic site for photoshoot"
Surami Fortress,Sergei Artemenko (We'll help),5,"This fortress is a very interesting object.  Nobody restores.  Entrance, of course, is free. Half an hour is enough for inspection. Shoes should be comfortable, such as sneakers."
Surami Fortress,Aman Rathod,4,"Surami Fortress is a hidden gem, nestled amidst breathtaking Georgian landscapes. With its rich history and stunning architecture, the fortress offers a captivating journey through time. A must-visit destination for history enthusiasts and nature lovers alike."
Surami Fortress,Nitesh Sharma,5,very good one. everyone must visit.
Surami Fortress,SATENDER KUMAR MISHRA,5,Fantastic & Beautiful fort and church! It's down a small alley with no parking but there's lots of streets around to park on. Enjoy with personal music system location for peace of mind
Surami Fortress,Shudhanshu Dwivedi,4,The view of this place is just mesmerizing.. i love to go there with my family and friends Often
Cetatea Făgărașului,Krzysztof Nosek,4,"I wanted to go there for a very long time. It’s a great and beautiful fortress and palace but painfully visibly restored (or should I say: being restored, even rebuilt?) The museums inside host quite interesting exhibitions, albeit local: some archeology, documents, folklore, art, including modern local artists. I was kind of disappointed by not seeing too much about the decade of 50’ when the castle was Stalinist prison and murder house. There was one exhibition on women helping the anti-communist resistance movement, though."
Cetatea Făgărașului,Marius Neagu,4,"If you are interested in local history and culture then you will spend about two hours visiting this place. What you will find in this beautiful renovated fortress: artefacts from the Dacian culture before the Roman conquest, items from the medieval times, including documents, weapons, torture chamber, live and style objects and more. You will have the opportunity to see the local German community art and design of furniture, garments and household items. It is remarkable the effort done to restore the building and the rooms. The new stained glass windows representing different Romanian coat of arms are outstanding. Four stars because of poor lights on small items like coins which could have a drawing aside for better understanding. Also an audio guide would be nice to have. All together, worth the time and trip to visit. PS At the time of this review, the main gate is in reconstruction."
Cetatea Făgărașului,luciana toma,5,"a place of history, beautifully restored and furnished. Tickets can only be purchased from the ticket office set up at the entrance to the citadel. The first documentary news attesting to the existence of the stone citadel is from 1455. It has an entire history full of events that you can find out from the guide in the citadel."
Cetatea Făgărașului,Andreea- Monica Sularia,5,"Very interesting, clean and well organised! Information available in English. Still under renovations but you can visit a large amount of room and outside areas."
Cetatea Făgărașului,Ulysses Papadopoulos,5,"Recently reconstructed fortress. One of the biggest we've visited in Romania. Large collection of artefacts starting from the bronze age. Extensive medieval items, armaments, furniture."
Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei,Marina Trencheva,5,"It's an interesting place to visit. Perfect to spend time with family and friends during the summer holidays. There's a car park nearby, about 10-15 minutes walking distance (it's more like a field used for a car park) next to the cemetery."
Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei,Andrei Meroniuc,4,"One of the best fortresses in the country. It was  rehabilitated a few years ago. There is lots of information available, including video. It is equipped with mannequin soldiers, weapons, paintings, furniture, etc. I gave it only 4* because of the gift shop, which was closed for the day because ""the shopkeeper didn't come to work""."
Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei,Alina Simon,5,Good atmosphere during the Medieval Festival. Well restaured building and nice reanactement shows.
Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei,Klaus Wanderer,5,"They've done a good job revamping the old fortress and even making the attempt to organize a museum inside with mixed results in my opinion.  Be sure to come here with good shoes, you will have to walk up a hill a considerable amount of steps, take a path that can be quite muddy depending on the weather and when you reach the fortress itself there are a few stairs to climb as well  The ticket is cheap for what is offered, be sure to take the combo including the visit to the Village Museum which is just en route to the citadel  Among the highlights are the pictures you can take of the nearby area. The museum features text in both English and Romanian so foreigners interested in history have a chance to explore the past of Moldova"
Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei,Marco M Katz,5,Great place to visit! Its reconstruction is a well-done job. If in Suceava don't miss it!
Peleș Castle,Andrea Landi,5,"This castle is so much better than Bran - the queues are similar though, so if you can pre book your ticket, that's highly recommended (I took a guided tour and we didn't queue).  The interiors are really spectacular, although I don't understand why you need to buy a separate ticket for the second floor.  If you have time to visit just one castle, go for this without hesitation."
Peleș Castle,Mohammad Alanzi,5,"Magnificent architecture. Beautiful interior and exterior. I bought a ticket online minutes before arriving, and it saved my day as the ticket line was very crowded on a Wednesday morning. I highly recommend buying the ticket online before arriving."
Peleș Castle,T Ryan,4,"4 stars because they keep calling this place a castle! It’s a palace or a mansion but not a castle. Although the exterior of the place is nice, it didn’t wow me like some other places I have visited. However,  the interior of the First floor is really impressive. At first we thought a tour is included with the ticket. That is not the case. They say you have to use the audio guide. We never tired and didn’t see anyone else using it either. You had best bring noise proof headphones to use it if you want to because the crowds and Noise can be Chaotic. If you are there early enough. You could be lucky like us to follow an official tour group/ guide and listen in on the stories. Like most places a guide is really needed to make the most of your visit and appreciate what you are seeing.  We bought the ticket for all floors. Only do this if money is not a concern for you. The third floor is very basic living quarters. The second floors is slightly more impressive living quarters for the king and wife. I wish they opened the windows so we would see the views but they have them closed. Sort of glad I saw the whole place but also wished I saved some money as well.  The upper floors have only a few people viewing it. So it is one way to get away from the crowds. Interesting to note that none of the offical tour groups/ guides went to the third or second floor. I found this surprising as I’m sure there is lots of interesting stories to tell about these floors."
Peleș Castle,Tsvetelina Dimova,5,Beautiful architecture! The location is really nice.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby. People are also selling fresh forest fruits. Definitely consider getting your tickets online! The line for buying tickets on site was huge! We waited between 15-20 mins to get in even with online tickets.
Peleș Castle,Federico Chiavegati,5,"As an architect I really adore this castle. Nearly every room embodies a different historical style, one could practically teach architectural history by touring it. The outside is gorgeous as well, with a well decorated garden and excellent mountain view. Strongly recommend."
Byzantine Castle of Platamon,Martin Fekete,4,"It has a spectacular view, the fares of the tickets are great (free for EU citizens under 25). It is good that after the exhausting journey up the hill to the castle, there are plenty of space to relax under the trees, so in the summer it is also okay. The only thing that I miss is proper exhibition-like experience: displayed information or visualized historical elements."
Byzantine Castle of Platamon,Lajos Szilard Bana,5,"Wondeful old castle with amazing view to paralia beach, and also to the mountains. The ticket is 3 euro each person. You can have a nice, about 20-30 minutes walk inside. Actually is quiet big castle, had some nice point where you can take lovely pictures from the surrounding. Absolute must visit these place if you are in the area."
Byzantine Castle of Platamon,Pardalis Georgios,5,"After so many years, I had the privilege to visit that beautiful castle. An overall pleasant experience with some minus.  - poor lighting in some places - garbage close to the church that could have been treated better - poor signing  As I said, though, it is a privilege to visit that place"
Byzantine Castle of Platamon,manos psathas,5,"In a landscape of unparalleled beauty in the south of The Prefecture of Pieria in Platamonas, lies the Castle of Platamonas, one of the most beautiful and best preserved castles in Greece. It is built at a strategic point, on a rocky protrusion, in the blue waters of the Aegean, in the area that fully verifies the name of the place: PLATAMON means ""rocky edges on the sea"". It is worth visiting it even if you do not wish to see a castle because it is sure that the endless view to Halkidiki, the coasts from Katerini to Mesagkalas, west the village of Neos Panteleimonas and northwest the mountain Olympus will compensate him. The distance from the parking lot to the entrance of the castle is about 300 meters."
Byzantine Castle of Platamon,Johanna Ferguson,5,A beautiful piece of history where you can admire the ruins of a 10th Century fortress. The entrance fee is €3 and worth it especially if you want to take amazing pictures of the surrounding area. You can even take a walk around the fortress and see more beautiful views.
Chinese Palace,Ada Wong,5,"Beautiful building outside, inside is restored with exhibits, you cannot take photos in the Chinese Palace building."
Chinese Palace,ken diment,5,A very nice museum I think you cost about €3 to go inside well worth it lots to see
Chinese Palace,Pavlo Zamroz,5,Nice and well preserved from the outside. Have many exhibitions but some of them are not allowed to take pictures.
Chinese Palace,Oleksandr Stefanovskyi,4,"An amazing exhibition of old Chinese, Indian and Turkish relics but unfortunately it is for some reason forbidden to take photos here."
Chinese Palace,Margaret B.,5,"MONUMENT of POLISH HISTORY Zolochiv Castle  (Zamek w Złoczowie) was a residence of the Sobieski Polish noble family.  The Chinese Palace, a diminutive mauve-colored rotunda flanked by one-storey wings, was added inside the fort later in XVII century as Polish King Jan III's gift to his French-born wife, Marysieńka (Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien)."
Afyonkarahisar Castle,Šimon Pitoňák,4,"I didn't visit the castle. It was hard to find the route up. Thought the city was very nice, especially the old buildings belom the castle."
Afyonkarahisar Castle,Eren Polat,3,"This 3500 year+ national treasure is just left by itself… there isn’t even a rubbish bin which left the whole place covered in plastic bottles and trash… If there had been a simple cafeteria the revenue of which would clearly payout the cleaning up and maintaining from point on…Other than that, good for The Town to build comfortable stairs to the castle, however, if you want to climb the very last pitch leading to the very peak you need to climb the ancient stairs which are carved into the rock… wish the modern stairway led to the very peak. Overall this can be a great “fat burning” trip with your family.."
Afyonkarahisar Castle,Hajar alwan,4,Climbing to the top of the castle is very tiring but the view from the top is very beautiful and there is a tea seller and some snacks upstairs
Afyonkarahisar Castle,Ирина Халикова,5,Beautiful view from the castle. You need a  good health to get there.😉
Afyonkarahisar Castle,HANI AL-SHALAL,5,"It's an amazing place, but too high 😅💔 ""you have to be an athlete"" just kidding 😜"
Fortica Fortress,Local Guide,5,"Well worth the hike up several stairs out of the town center then up a winding path with fantastic views. €10 per adult and €5 for kids (under 19) with amazing views. It gets crowded with cruise ship guests when they are in town and is quote exposed and can be hot. Best advice is to go early at 9am when it opens, much more pleasant walk up, limited crowds and overall a better experience"
Fortica Fortress,Kurt Ohrenberger,5,"Great experience. The view of Hvar from the top of the fortress is incredible and worth the money alone. The climb is nothing strenuous if you choose to walk. Doing so takes you through the pretty, narrow streets of Hvar and constant views as you wind up a few paths to the entrance.  The fortress itself is good to look around, we took it all in. The best time to go is just before sunset when the weather is cooler. You get to see Hvar city with lingering daylight and it as the lights come on. Well worth the visit!"
Fortica Fortress,Davide Buzzi,4,"Nice fortress, the walk up to it offers stunning view of the sea and the island. The fortress itself didn't feel worth the ticket €10pp  The jail was interesting although very little description can be found. Interesting the old amphoras and utensils of a shipwrek found in the sea and stored in the fortress. The visit could be probably skipped, however, beautiful views."
Fortica Fortress,Emma Powell,5,"About 10min walk to the sight from the harbour. Walking up a lot of steps to get to the sight, then up slight diagonal staggerd hills to the top. So be wary if you struggle with steps. Lovely walk to the top, stopping to admire stunning views and photo opportunities. There was an ice cream stand halfway. And benches at the top to sit and admire the view.  Going in the Fort was quiet, not busy and interesting, and had a souvenir shop and a small restaurant. Worth a visit."
Fortica Fortress,Jads,5,"The €10 entry fee is steep but the views are genuinely amazing - if the weathers nice. If its raining/cloudy I wouldn’t recommend it. Besides the views there is a nice cafe and some souvenir shops in the complex too, as well as a toilet. Also a very small museum like area to see some sunken ship artefacts which are interesting and a small prison to visit too. An hour is probably enough time here."
Tira-Bilgorod Settlement - archeological monum...,Larysa Sokolova,4,"Excavations are underway near the Akkerman fortress. This is the ancient city of Thira, or rather, what is left of it. Nothing is eternal, everything is passing in the material world.)"
Tira-Bilgorod Settlement - archeological monum...,Андрій Сніжок,5,"The remains of the ancient city are interesting to explore. A bit of history. In the 4th century BC e. on the island washed by two branches of Tiras (Dniester), the inhabitants of Miletus established a polis, which was named Ophius (""city of snakes""), due to the large number of reptiles. Soon, on the high right bank of the river, Thira grew up, a settlement of Scythian ploughmen. Over time, the differences between the polis were erased, the population mixed, forming a new community - the Scyphohellines, or Mixellines. And when, as a result of the rise in the level of the World Ocean, Ophius was flooded, its inhabitants moved to Thira."
Tira-Bilgorod Settlement - archeological monum...,O K,5,"It is an interesting place, although it is only allowed to look at it from a little above, but it is clear that no one will allow people with our mentality to walk around such an ancient place. Conveniently located right next to the fortress, this place will be hard to miss, enjoy this antique!"
Tira-Bilgorod Settlement - archeological monum...,Валера Граматик,4,"Well-preserved large medieval fortress, standing on a rock above the estuary. There are competitions for tourists like archery and cannon shooting, minting coins, etc. You can order a guide and relax in the tiled tent."
Tira-Bilgorod Settlement - archeological monum...,Татьяна К.,5,"Liked this place very much. There are places to walk and spend time. If you are resting nearby, then I advise you to visit the Fortress. I personally traveled from Zatoka. 534 minibuses take you to the Fortress and it costs 18 UAH. The entrance itself is 50 UAH for an adult. Conduct interesting tours. There is something to photograph. In some places, the views are simply mesmerizing. It is advisable to dress warmly, as even in summer there was a strong and cold wind. I advise you to visit this place and touch a piece of history!"
Mamure Castle,Christopher Trageser,5,"Best castle in Turkey! Most castles are run down, but this one is in remarkable shape and has really interesting history that you should read about before visiting.  Furthermore, it's far off the tourist path (local and international) so most Turkish people don't even know about it and yet it's a beautiful rocky beach location as well."
Mamure Castle,Mike Lahaye,4,"Very well restored castle, one can freely roam around except on the high walls. Very limited information about the castle and its different structures or functions. Parking is directly near the main road, castle is signposted."
Mamure Castle,Gennady Lipenkov,5,"A great place to visit with children: restored castle, beautiful views. There is also a mosque building. From entertainment there are a lot of hungry turtles that swim at the entrance. They were not forbidden to feed them. But be careful if you feed them by hand: turtles can bite."
Mamure Castle,Konstantin Ivanov,5,"The place is beautyful, but be careful with stairecases, stairwells. There are plenty of insecure stone stairways out there. There is beach nearby. Apart of all typically listed there are some several hundred year old olive trees grows inside. Small shop kiosk, tap water source, turtles in the moat"
Mamure Castle,Richard Attoe,4,This is a massive seaside fortress castle well worth a visit. I think it is still closed for the restoration work that is still being done. I walked all around the outside perimeter at low tide its OK to just get around. The restoration work is fantastic craftsmanship to restore this fortress and once all is finished it's going to be even more amazing. Highly recommend.
Tmogvi Fortress,berika tsutskiridze,5,"first of all there need to be good road, and 100% restoring it takes, this AMAZING place one of the best place of our country !"
Tmogvi Fortress,Michael Pope,5,"Tmogvi Fortress has amazing views of the valley below.  But I recommend against climbing all the way up to the castle, as the “trail” is very treacherous.  You could easily slip & tumble down the hill; I almost did.  If you have a drone, bring it and get your good pics that way.  Also, the road up to the fortress is quite difficult without a 4x4, but I did manage to slowly make it up there with a Toyota Prius."
Tmogvi Fortress,Gáspár Parlagi,5,"The Tmogvi Fortress is not easy to reach (15 min by car [4x4 recommended] or 25 min by walk) but definitely worth it!  One of the most beautiful view have ever seen! On a painting I would say the artist pushed it a bit too far such a beautiful composition does not exist in reality - but if you are there you must accept that, nevertheless,  yet there is... ;-)"
Tmogvi Fortress,Zuzanna Molska,5,"There is a small bridge from which a dirt road takes you up the hill, straight to the fortress. It’s accessible via 4x4, though it’s a slow and bumpy ride. I wouldn’t recommend it to drivers afraid of heights. The views are amazing even if you don’t decide to climb the ruins themselves."
Tmogvi Fortress,drasutis jatuzis,5,Nice castle
Smbataberd Սմբատաբերդ,Arman Khachatryan,5,"Breathtaking views, brilliant location. Smbataberd was built in a very advantageous position on the southern end of a ridge, guarded by steep cliffs on three of its sides. Very large ramparts with towers are still relatively intact on the exterior. Within the confines of the fortress little remains except for the faint foundations of buildings near the fortification walls and a keep located at the highest point of the site."
Smbataberd Սմբատաբերդ,Jacqueline L,5,"Interesting and not yet very touristic fortress, beautifully located on top of a hill. Quite a little walk 300mtr uphill from the valley, which is worth a visit anyway."
Smbataberd Սմբատաբերդ,Alen Muradyan,5,"Though you can find just ruins of what once was called castle, it still remains a big deal to get there. We recommend to get there on foot or by a car. (Only SUV can do that). High impressions guaranteed when you finally reach the place."
Smbataberd Սմբատաբերդ,Mari P.,5,"Beautiful scenic hike, and great views from the fortress"
Smbataberd Սմբատաբերդ,Albert Art,5,"Smbataberd Fortress  140km from Yerevan. See location Smbataberd fortress is built from 10 to 13cc., but some sources mention major battle at the fortress in 5th c.. Today it’s one of the biggest staying fortress in Armenia. You can reach the fortress walking from villages Yeghegis (3km) and Artabuynk (2.5km), but the road to Yeghegis is better, or by rover from Artabuynk. No one foto can pass all impressions of real fellings from this place!!"
Château de la Treyne,Cédric L.,5,"We had an outstanding stay. Amazing location, top notch service and of course Michelin star restaurant. The staff did everything to care and attend to us. I would highly recommend."
Château de la Treyne,Stine W,4,"This hotel could be incredible but it is rough around the edges in ways that distract from the overall good impression.  Every room is different so choose your room by the photos on the website.  The wonderful: -The rooms are very comfortable, quiet, and the climate control works very well. -the food is delicious -The location is right on the river and nearby many beautiful places -There are walks and nature excursions accessible right from the hotel -staff are very friendly  Needs improvement: -there are no casual dining options and the restaurant is often full. We had to plan to eat away from the hotel for multiple nights. This is annoying when you're at a countryside hotel and you can't walk anywhere. -parking is limited and shared with restaurant patrons. There was often insufficient parking for guests. -too many gates in the property are closed. This means it is hard to enjoy the nature -breakfast service was very slow. It is not included in the room rate which was annoying since the service was not very good. We had to wait 15 minutes for a cup of coffee! -there should be coffee and tea in the rooms. It was annoying to try to find a member of staff just to have an espresso. It was good espresso, but a hassle. -hotel seems understaffed. When we arrived we had to look around to find someone. -poor ratio of price to quality considering the level of service and amenities.  If these issues were corrected I would be eager to visit again and happily pay the high room rate.  As it is now it feels overpriced"
Château de la Treyne,Mitch Stewart,5,So much history and beauty to see here. Stunning grounds and views. 5 star service. The rooms are all unique and well done. Towels are luxurious and fluffy. On site bakery and Michelin level chef. Beautiful pool area and fountains. So much art to check out. There are even hidden surprises in the stairwell…. Breakfast is worth the price too.
Château de la Treyne,Sam Marsden,5,"We go to the restaurant for special occasions and it's wonderful. It's like walking into a fairytale. The castle is stunning. The staff are welcoming. The food is off the charts spectacular — delicious, beautiful, and creative. It's such a treat to go here. I highly recommend a visit for an unforgettable experience!"
Château de la Treyne,Dominik Spahn,5,"In the course of a trip with our automobile club, we were allowed to spend four days at the Chateau. In addition to the fantastic location and the beautiful rooms, we were royally taken care of. Among other things, we enjoyed a five and a seven course menu from the hotel's own kitchen, which will remain in our memories."
Château du Rivau,Ricky Clark,5,"Just love this place, the gardens are amazing. You can spend hours here and still miss loads. The photos do not do justice to it and best of all dogs are welcome and massive carpark if you want to park the motorhome near by"
Château du Rivau,James Ruddick,5,Really enjoyed this lovely Chateau. Interesting inside and lovely gardens. Quite a bit for kids to do. Also good food.
Château du Rivau,Lindsey Reece-Smith,4,"We went to this Chateau with family, including an assortment of young grandchildren. The gardens were lovely, I especially appreciated the music around some areas which was very relaxing. We sat on picnic benches to eat our lunch in the shade and all worked well. Careful of the hammocks as one child fell out! 5 rooms in the castle. One is a shrine yo Joan of Arc and the others have art, not quite to our taste, but all in all a good day out"
Château du Rivau,Colin Spark,3,"Beautiful chateau and garden's spoilt by too much ""clever"" art. Sadly we couldn't get anything to eat or drink in the terrace restaurant as it was fully booked and under staffed. Shame that we weren't informed that we needed to book when we bought our entry tickets two hours earlier. ☹️"
Château du Rivau,Krista MacKinlay,4,"A quirky, artsy, fun. A must see for everyone. Dogs on leash in garden are allowed. Food on site. Great gift store. Woods and gardens are enjoyable to visit."
Château de Miromesnil,Jakko van Ingen,5,"A fantastic place to stay! A beautiful castle, inspiring gardens and truly phenomenal hosts. The musical tour in the garden is highly recommended, too."
Château de Miromesnil,Thai Nguyen,5,"Beautiful place. Stunning château and garden. Just lovely. Very friendly staff. Small sitting area for viewing the scenery. Only con is the café does not have a large selection, but it’s understandable. View of the château compensated for that. Thank you for the experience."
Château de Miromesnil,Matthieu Hattab,4,"We didn't visit the castle or stayed at the guest house. We only went for the vegetable garden. It was fantastic and the lady gardener was super nice, friendly and patient to explain her job and give advice and tips. She was wonderful."
Château de Miromesnil,Irina Malkmus,5,Great experience! Interesting touristic location with a castle and garden. Very nice cafe with shop. Very good English is spoken there.
Château de Miromesnil,Philippe Socias,4,"Nice place, the visit takes between 1h and 1h30, you will see the gardens, a chapel and some parts of the ground floor of the castle. If you want more, it's possible to stay in one of their guestrooms."
Château de Montreuil-Bellay,Mark Wade,4,Didn't go inside but beautiful exterior.   Didn't plan to come here because of the chateaux however really enjoyed the area.  Unexpected find.  Close to the campsite discovered a FREE electric charging point  - perfect if you have an e-bike.
Château de Montreuil-Bellay,Vijay Bhardwaj,5,Wonderful castle. Well worth a visit with an accredited guide. Good views from and inside the castle. Today the castle was visited by the french army - 2nd Dragons based nearby. Friendly forces.
Château de Montreuil-Bellay,Ein jel Line,5,"We arrive here after lunch and they are still open for tourist and the entrance is already a wow factor. The people in the reception are friendly and accommodating. The castle is well maintained, interesting old furnitures and the garden is absolutely gorgeous specially now the fall season there are lots of color around. We enjoyed our tour. Merci!"
Château de Montreuil-Bellay,Rob Freeman,5,"Really good place, it has English translations, the views are great also the wine tasting as the end is brilliant I got two bottles of the blanc cremont very reasonably priced it's great."
Château de Montreuil-Bellay,janet banks,5,"A beautiful building, lots of interesting information and access to the battlements"
Château de Jumilhac - Location salle de récept...,Paul J.,3,A little disappointed. Beautiful castle from the outside but we only visit a small part. The old part of the castle is rarely visited. The more recent part is very beautiful. At the end of the visit I learn that you can visit the frame and the upper part of the castle. But extra. The garden is average.
Manoir de Livet,Oleksii Domochka,5,"The place was extraordinary! Our stay there was unforgettable and we are so glad we got to live in this beautiful chateau. The house is filled with history and resembles the insides of a castle located right opposite of the chateau. The view is to die for and the atmosphere is even more astonishing. If you don’t get the chance to stay there over night, make sure to still visit their cafe (creperie), you will not be disappointed. Stopping by is a must. The owners were very welcoming and friendly, we are so glad we got to meet them. Those were one of our best nights spent in France!"
Manoir de Livet,Christopher Sterbenz,5,"Superb overnight accommodation immediately adjacent to the chateau. The setting is something out of a pleasant fairy tale. Christophe the owner is friendly and helpful with recommendations. One point to bear in mind is that signs for the house are not easily visible, the home is immediately next to the chateau up a gravel driveway but hidden from the street."
Manoir de Livet,nofacefashion “Mihaela Bălan”,5,"One of the most beautiful stays in Normandie. Décor, landscape, hospitality - don’t miss it! ♥️"
Manoir de Livet,Diane ROSSI,4,"Exceptional setting with a view of the magnificent castle of Saint Germain de Livet, its moats, its garden, its swans and its peacocks, well decorated and comfortable room. The dishes are simple but good. The welcome is warm. Only big downside, we were very cold (barely 16 -18 degrees in the living room and bedroom) which spoiled the stay a bit."
Manoir de Livet,Maëva Alix,5,"What to say… in fact, there would be so much to say. We were lucky enough to be able to discover this magical place. Magical, made possible thanks to the love of the owners, who also resemble this place, magical it seems? Yes, we recommend this mansion, in order to spend wonderful moments, create if you wish.  Thank you to the masters of this mansion.  Simon and Maeva"
Château d'Anjou,MichaelNM,5,"We went for a wedding weekend. The building is a magnificent party place. I cannot comment on the kitchen facilities because I was a guest but the food was great, the music was perfect for the audience. We were never too hot or cold and everyone enjoyed the evening through till 5 in the morning. A picturesque place to have a wedding or just a great party."
Château d'Anjou,Elaine Wellock,5,"We have just spent a wonderful time here at Chateau d'Anjou at my son's wedding. The Chateau is beautifully well maintained , the accommodation is very atmospheric and historical and the grounds are superb. It was a perfect venue for the wedding. The owner was always available if needed and was very friendly and helpful I would recommend this place to anyone."
Château d'Anjou,Maria V,5,"We spent a beautiful time at the castle where we slept for 2 wonderful nights!! The atmosphere was great and the reception of the wedding was given in the castle's theater.. Everything was absolutely beautiful and perfect, thanks also to the lovely owners! Recommend!!"
Château d'Anjou,Max Prashad,4,"Very beautiful, lovely scenery amazing place to spend time had a great time they're at a lovely wedding. Quite a way out not much to do in the surrounding areas but great place to have a relaxing time"
Château d'Anjou,Ingemar Nordblom,4,Beautiful Wedding
Vedettes Panoramiques,kevin smith,5,This boat trip around the lac with the Castle was fantastic. Ask for Captain Julien for the best tips of the Region.
Vedettes Panoramiques,céline thomas,5,We had a great time on the boat. The captain and his father are adorable and humorous. The course is nice and we learn a lot about the history of the dam. Reasonable price for an outing of 1h15/20. The children in the boat were all able to hold the helm for a while. Really perfect 👍
Vedettes Panoramiques,David Blanchon,5,"Very nice panoramic boat cruise ⛴ on the water reservoir of the Bort les Orgues dam. Boarding at the bottom of the very beautiful Château de Val. History of the Dordogne valley, and the three villages drowned under water, very well told, with a lot of humor, 👍😂 by the Captain. Children and ""big children"" who wanted were able to hold the bar. To recommend and to do again."
Vedettes Panoramiques,cédric Mahieu,5,Very amusing comments allow you to understand this expanse of water which is the confluence of several departments and regions. The lake is 23 km long. Free parking but you have to walk a little. Free beach. Various water activities possible. Paying castle visits on part
Vedettes Panoramiques,mikael pietrequin,5,Ballad well commented with a lot of humor from the captain. The landscape is wonderful
National Museum and the Château de Pau - Official,Doron Shwartz,4,"A visit to a place that includes passing between the different rooms requires about an hour and a half, if you visit the adjacent garden then a little more. Nice well preserved not particularly impressive. Be sure to plan your entry before or after a lunch break when the place is closed to new visitors for one hour from 12-1pm."
National Museum and the Château de Pau - Official,Jenna Durrant,5,"Only visited external but that was well worth it, charming old beauty."
National Museum and the Château de Pau - Official,Tally,5,Beautiful museum! It's very interesting to learn about the history of this chateau and the people who have lived in it and to see the furnitures and the different rooms. The staff were very knowledgeable and helpful with information in English. We really enjoyed it!
National Museum and the Château de Pau - Official,A Traveler,1,"Everyone working at this castle should be fired immediately!  First, the QR code at the entrance leads to a dead site.  Second, I was finally able to find the correct site to reserve the tour and received the email confirmation.  Third, walked through the rain this morning and then arrived to a closed door!  They are too lazy to work, so they shut the castle down without notice!  How aggressively hostile do you have to be toward the people who pay your wages (the visitors) to not even bother to give advance notice, or at least send an email to those who have made the stupid reservations!?!?  The level of inconsiderate behavior absolutely boggles the mind!"
National Museum and the Château de Pau - Official,Moosa Awadah,5,Amazing piece of history and culture in the middle of the city centre. Worth the guided tour for a quick look into the past and how the castle was passed along from century to century.
Castle Laréole,Benjamin TALLIER,5,"We went to this castle for the first time and we had the chance to see two different exhibit of local artist. The castle by itself is quick to visit but it has some non négligeable charme and the little tea room makes it for a nice shadowed place to enjoy a glass of wine after walking in the park. I recommend coming here on a Sunday, there are a few walks to do around and parking is free."
Castle Laréole,tegan wylie (Teegs),5,"Absolutely beautiful beautiful beautiful castle. It's simple, elegant and refined. I'd say my dream wedding location for sure!"
Castle Laréole,Sophy Gaines,5,Pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Nice grounds and small chateau to wander around surrounded by lovely countryside. Art exhibitions and café to occupy yourself.
Castle Laréole,JP Nacif Drah,4,"Cute “castle”.  The place is nice but relatively small, more so when you compare it with other castles around.  When we went, there was a concert going on in the courtyard, so we had a lot of fun.  Watch for activities going on to time it right.  The art inside was ok.  Nothing special."
Castle Laréole,Walk Faw,5,Lovely place to visit. Beautiful setting.
Château de Cheverny,androgynbeauty,5,"It's a very nice castle with beautiful gardens, but the interior is a little crowdie. The rooms are marvellous but small and inside access isn't always allowed. In general, there are many restrictions during the visit.  There are very modern and interesting exhibitions alongside the historical castle; during our visit there was one of LEGO creations hidden into the rooms. Very cool idea! Into the gardens there was also a sculpture exhibition, nice."
Château de Cheverny,Nick Brown,4,Not a classic château but recommended by friends. Ornate inside. Amazing tapestries. Lots of history. Fun maze. Boat trip and electric buggy ride worth going on. The hosts there were very knowledgeable.
Château de Cheverny,Kari S,5,"Absolutely beautiful home! Of the three places we visited in the Loire Valley (Chambord, Chenonceau, and Cheverny this was our favorite.  It had all the history and drama, but it felt loved and lived in. The gardens were gorgeous!"
Château de Cheverny,Isaac,5,Very nice Castle to visit. It is one of my preferred castles at Loire Valley. Well maintained and beautiful grounds.
Château de Cheverny,Hesham Ibrahim,5,"Great experience enjoying the chateaus in Loire valley, better to get a guided tour to learn about the place and culture more. Decoration and gardens are amazing as well, worth the visit, I would recommend it to people visiting the area"
Château de Bannes,joe higham,5,Where Cinderella and Rapunzel decided to have their love-child...
Château de Bannes,Monique Paris,5,Photos taken on a hiking trail: the loop of the crow from Bayac. Very pretty castle in a green setting.
Château de Bannes,Gerard DUVAL,5,Cannot be visited but the view is worth the detour!
Château de Bannes,Sandrine d'Armagnac,5,"Seen from the outside, a very beautiful castle, great walk in a calm and green setting"
Château de Bannes,Adeline Neveu,4,Too bad the castle can no longer be visited.
Château de Chaumont,Michaela Salmon,5,Great place with amazing gardens! It costs 20 euros to get in but for that you can visit the chateau as well as the extensive gardens. There is a lot of contemporary art in the chateau and also in the grounds. Lots of space to have a picnic and you could easily spend all day here and not get bored.
Château de Chaumont,Myrdon Corrino,5,"Lovely little castle on a very large plot of land. I spent a fair couple of hours enjoying the garden exhibits of the Festival International des Jardins in the morning, and quite some time exploring the castle in the afternoon. If the weather had been better, I would have explored a bit more of the castle grounds."
Château de Chaumont,Alexandra-Gabriela Comandasu,5,"French people so lucky! Their heritage is impressive on so many levels, but this castle is an experience worth celebrating. It is not a place, is a multitude of stories and places that meet to provide pleasure for eye and mind. Is a place I will definitely visit again in the future. Inside and out, architecture, art, floral arrangements, gardens, everything is so unique and incredibly beautiful. This was the first place I visited on our visit to France and it did not disappoint, furthermore it has increased my confidence that I need to visit more of their places. Well kept and fairly priced, Chateau de Chaumont is an absolute masterpiece. Thank you for having us 🫧"
Château de Chaumont,Sander Hendriks,5,"Great experience, the castle was lovely also the art/expositions. We had a drink and tarte at the petit restaurant, especially the tarte was amazing. And finally the gardens, what a spectacle, our kids also loved it because of the great displays and coloured waters."
Château de Chaumont,Ioannis Malekos,5,"Impressive château and gardens, beautifully arranged rooms, many choices for coffee, drinks and lunch in the many places in the gardes. Also, art exhibitions on the premises"
Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil,Erwin T,4,"Really a nice castle, the guide did the tour with lots of passion. Tip: please improve/expand the English version of the tour. An audio goude would also be great.  Extra points: for the charge station. Free charging ❤️ The lovely restaurant: food and service are very good!"
Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil,Henryk Loska,5,"Worth seeing, with a nice park, the castle from 14th century encircled by a moat is the most south-located castle in the Valley of Loire. Entry shop with souvenirs and tickets to buy. Nice surroundings. A super guide named Etienne will walk you around through the rooms of the castle. Only for French speaking visitors."
Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil,Benjamin de Krom,2,Unfortunaly the tour is only possible in French. And there are construction works going on. The sound of the builders radio is very loud. The interieur is nice also is the gardens in the back of the terrain.
Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil,Kelly Donovan,3,"Beautiful location, however cafe was full and little shop was closed.  We didn't go in the castle as tour was in French only and we had a buggy."
Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil,Bernard Lejeune,5,"Again a top location. Ideal for family visit with special attention for kids. Thanks for the lady at the ""accueil"" and the guide. Plan your visit including a guided tour."
Château de Puyguilhem,Yvonne Quiroz Ambriz,4,"Lovely setting, stunning building. 2 floors to explore, quite a small place (for a château?!) Everyone loves a café though 😉 but I understand there isn't enough demand during quiet season. Maybe a coffee machine?"
Château de Puyguilhem,Debbie Tuck,5,"We loved this Château, such great work has been done to restore this beautiful building. The only improvement I could suggest would be a small cafe.. but this could be said for many Châteaux."
Château de Puyguilhem,Harmen BROUCKE,5,Beautiful renovated chateau with very capable guide
Château de Puyguilhem,Katia Castrillo,5,"Really nice castle, impressive structures, fireplaces The best was the guide who conveyed his passion for the history of the castle in a fun way Highly recommended stop in the Périgord"
Château de Puyguilhem,RD Flo,5,"Lovely chateau to visit, nothing too fancy or complicated, but a beautiful early renaissance place. The tour was very friendly, tidy, informative and for our kids, didn't last too long."
Logis Hostellerie du Château,Quinten Uijldert,3,"Visited 3 times. First time was very nice, and very friendly.  When we came back the 2nd time I practically had to beg for the bill and was rudely ignored by a young waitress.  The 3rd time we just wanted some drinks but were sent away with some feeble excuse.  The Pizzeria across the road however was very accommodating!"
Logis Hostellerie du Château,Z H,2,"It looks correct in picture, but that's only in pictures, they seem to have renovated the bathroom but it's only the wall tiles, the bathtub was very old and filthy with some hair from the previous customer. The old carpet all over the room is outdated, probably a vestige of 70's, same for the wall paper, my parents were having the same one during the 90's. A light bulb was missing, probably to help hiding the misery of the room, the 2 stools nearby the bed were all stained and mucky . They have a nice bed cover to hide a terribly ugly and shabby woollen blanket. The walls are so thin you can hear your neighbours whispering... I would have put only one star but the breakfast with a large choice of viennoiseries and all sorts of breakfast, from charcuterie and cheese to basic cereal cheered me up on morning. Thanks for the breakfast but no thanks for the rooms."
Logis Hostellerie du Château,Susanne,1,"Unfortunately, there was no stay as the hotel did let us in and did not answer to any means of communication despite having agreed the arrival time upfront by phone."
Logis Hostellerie du Château,Andreas Beckmann,2,"Solid but uninspired cuisine by French standards, and quite expensive for it"
Logis Hostellerie du Château,Camille Ancay,5,"Magnificent establishment, close to the castle, Spartan rooms but with undeniable charm. Very good value for money. Perfect service with charming people with their smiles and the quality of their service. Cheer"
Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,Alexandra-Gabriela Comandasu,5,"My favourite chateau. This is taken out of a princess movie. Absolutely impressive and it gives that hint of magic. Not much to say about the inside as I was still shell shocked by its outside looks - but I am convinced it was beautiful and interesting. I will absolutely return, even once in this life."
Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,53 mph,5,This beautiful chateau is a delight to walk around (especially with your dog). The gardens are not as spectacular as other chateaus in the area but better better shaded and with more green grass for just lazing about on while admiring the castle. The chateau itself is quite small inside but very well preserved. Photographers will love the 360 degree shots you can get of this castle. There is paid parking close to the castle. Dogs are admitted to the ground but must be carried in a bag inside the castle.
Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,James McKee,5,"One of the jewels of the chateaux of the Loire. Made of striking white stone and sitting in the middle of its own lake. It has different facades so make time to walk around the lake on the nature paths and enjoy it from different angles. Sometimes you can catch the chateau reflecting in the pool. There are rooms inside with decorations from different periods that it was occupied, and they span several hundred years. There are some lovely paintings also. A word of warning there are many staircases and the round ones are very steep. There is a restaurant onsite and a gift shop. There are multiple paid parking lots but a certain T navigation put me behind the castle, while the big G put me in the nearby town. Well worth the price of admission. If not too busy plan for 1.5-2 hours."
Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,David Stedman,4,Beautiful château. Nice walk inside and around the gardens. Not too long so perfect for a couple of hours. Nice ice-cream in cafe too.
Château d'Azay-le-Rideau,Linda Loder,5,"A good visitor experience- friendly welcome, beautiful château and grounds, good refreshments and shop. The roof restoration in the attics is very impressive, and we enjoyed the recreation of C16 life on the upper floor as contrasted with the C19 on the lower, mirroring the life of the château. A good exhibition outside, pleasant grounds to walk in, including the 'mirror pools ' that reflect the building, and as a gardener I enjoyed the Secret Garden."
Château de Fénelon,Jonathan Golby,5,"Best chateau in the region. Fully furnished, numerous original artifacts on display, excellent self guided tour in English or French. And not mobbed with tourists. Better than Beynac or Biron."
Château de Fénelon,Bertil Snel,4,Fun castle to visit. We were here in October with two teenage kids. We would’ve liked an audio tour but the written descriptions were also very informative. We like how each room is decorated with lots of details in each in its own style.
Château de Fénelon,Rémi Pallaro,4,"Good displays in all rooms, unfortunately widely in french only."
Château de Fénelon,Neil Baker,5,Very well presented a real insight into our past
Château de Fénelon,George Davies,5,"A hidden gem of a castle which is one of the less obvious ones around the Dordogne area. Genuinely interesting and well preserved collections of Fenelon's possessions and a ""cabinet of curiosities"". The castle itself has interesting traditional defenses and brilliant views of the valley below. Price is reasonable and the visit's duration is long enough."
Mairie de Duras,Michel Grenouillat,5,Ras
Mairie de Duras,Jean-Marc B,3,"48 hours ago, I went to Duras 6:30 p.m. It was dark. No public lighting. In front of the castle, unlit, where there is a stop sign, no lighting. INADMISSIBLE. I know that municipalities have to save energy, at present, but this is a bit too much and VERY DANGEROUS. There are solar street lights that work very well. See the town next door, Lévignac de Guyenne. There will have to be a serious accident, before doing the necessary?"
Mairie de Duras,SEVERINE PRINCE,1,"For an identity card for my son (leaving for Germany in mid-September). A message had to be sent to us to retrieve it. Message not sent suddenly my son could not leave when the CNI had arrived in time!!! Call from the person in charge of the CNI who tells us that we can pick her up whenever we want, any day. Reception of the deplorable and more than unpleasant secretary who questioned the fact that her colleague called us, that he told us that we could pick her up!!! To avoid !!!"
Mairie de Duras,Louann cheze,1,For an ID card request they are only open on Tuesday morning and Thursday morning which is complicated for people who work! Moreover when we find the time to call them the person who picks up is very unpleasant we seem to annoy him! The staff should be reviewed!
Mairie de Duras,caroline goursolle,1,The person at the reception is very unpleasant always the impression of disturbing her she blows and speaks badly! At least when you manage to have someone on the phone! More than 2 weeks that I call to make an appointment for my ID and impossible to reach anyone or it picks up and hangs up immediately! It is absurd!
Château d'Ussé,Kath Ch,4,"Quite charming, but really crowded in the high season. The sleeping beauty tower was fun and the gardens are quite well kept and very pretty. The parking is free, but very small, could be difficult to find a parking place here. Also, not many food options around."
Château d'Ussé,Frederic St-Onge,5,"Castle definitely worth the detour. It is super photogenic and amazing to look at. I love the part where you visit the castle and follow the story of sleeping beauty. Just make sure to pay attention to the signs or you will not do the story in the right order. The castle itself is nice, but there is not a lot to see in it. The owners still live in it so access is somewhat restricted. Outside the castle, there are a few other places to visit, but they don’t take a long time. Overall, happy I did it and would do again."
Château d'Ussé,Ricky Clark,5,"This is again another lovely Chateau from the Lourie Valley. Parked just outside, plenty of space most days. We got there at 9.30 so we could park the motorhome under a tree. There was a sign advising against it, but it looked OK and it was a hot day. I suspect I would have not if it was windy. You can walk around most parts with the dog. Not a great deal to see in the actual chateau but loads of other places to look around and still lovely gardens."
Château d'Ussé,Callum Norney,4,Great château with lots to see. The attic requires more attention from staff. Very narrow stairs that people can only go up or down. The number of people going up should be controlled as it is a small space and is not really worth it to be honest. I’ll attach and image of the attic. Food place opposite was very very greasy would take food with me if i visited again.
Château d'Ussé,Oana Leanca,5,"A castle from the fairytales. Follow the sleeping beauty story and learn lots of history in this very nice castle, with a beautiful garden and old chapel. Across the castle, near the parking lot, you can take a break with some good food or just a coffee. Put d'Ussé on the list while visiting Loire."
Château Royal d'Amboise,Alexandra-Gabriela Comandasu,5,"We got here by accident. The place was not on our list of attractions, but I am thrilled we did. Even if it was raining, the château was beautiful and it proved to be a hidden gem. Is not much when you see it from the outside, but seen in its entire splendour from the other side of the Loire, is magnificent. And the views, breathtaking! Will definitely return and I must say, their gardeners are very skilled and busy people, and they are doing an extraordinarily good job."
Château Royal d'Amboise,Puneet Ghai,5,"Absolutely well-maintained, awe-inspiring rich history and captivating architecture. The visit experience was truly enchanting, amazed by the stunning views from the chateau. It's a place that truly transports you back in time and leaves a lasting impression. anyone interested in history and culture. 🏰😊 will find it absolutely fascinating. (at Euros 15.50 per person entry fee)"
Château Royal d'Amboise,Jurgita Jurgita,5,"Really worth visiting, inside and outside. The view from the castle is stunning! The interior presents the great times, the items are well preserved, though the exposition is not huge, comparing to other Loire  valey castles."
Château Royal d'Amboise,Ruben Williams,4,A fun stop with excellent views. The guided tour is decent without being too much. Your going to exercise your legs a bit getting around but I think you've come for the history and the views and you will not be disappointed. Give yourself sometime to wander about and no that you will not be able to capture the sunset for the photographers in the crew.
Château Royal d'Amboise,Bogdan Marcelan,5,My wife and I spent a few days in Amboise as it was a wonderful base for us to visit the castles along the Loire. The castle offers a beautiful view of the city. There are also beautiful photos of the castle from the town across the river.
Les Quatre Châteaux de Lastours,Megan Taepke,5,"Great half-day tour from Carcassonne ! A very pleasant walk and incredible views.  As many others have advised, go in the morning when it's still cool, and wear appropriate clothes and shoes!  I came with my two dogs and the paths are dog friendly, except for some metallic pathways and the extremely narrow stairs in some of the towers"
Les Quatre Châteaux de Lastours,Daniil “Daniel” Kiselev,5,"A challenging, but very pleasant walk with historical landmarks worth exploring. Mind you, consider this, above all, a physical challenge, particularly if you will be trying to finish it within an hour or two. Make sure to check out some of the artifacts stored in the museum at the reception, they might give you an interesting perspective on the life of this medieval village."
Les Quatre Châteaux de Lastours,Miles,5,"Free parking at Tourist Information office. 5 mins to visitor centre. Full 'nouveau path' circuit takes 1hr20min including lots of stops for photos if you're moderately fit. Excellent overall, surpasses expectations. Good patisserie and restaurants nearby. Free clean public toilets."
Les Quatre Châteaux de Lastours,Nikolay Smirnov,4,"Very beautiful place, but for some reason you have to pay to hike on the path that leads you to the castles, but it is the only way to get there. The hike is abojt 40-60 minutes to the first castle and then another hour to visit the other ones."
Les Quatre Châteaux de Lastours,Cyrus Mower,5,"Stunning setting for fascinating ruins. Take water and good shoes and let your imagination run wild! (Very friendly, informative welcome, well maintained paths.)"
Castle of Biron,Michaël “Abe”,5,"A definite highlight of the area. Views are breathtaking, architecture is amazing and lots of history in the many rooms and corridors. Best start early to avoid crowds as it gets packed quickly"
Castle of Biron,Robert Fradgley,5,"Great place to go. Give yourself between 1-2 hrs to go around and actually enjoy. So much history and architecture, and the views are amazing."
Castle of Biron,A G,5,"Nice chateau, lots of steep steps and uneven floor at times so watch out! Lovely views from the top"
Castle of Biron,Lisa Wilson,5,Super château and we visit it several times through the year because there are lots of different things going on. I’ve choses several photos to illustrate this. Fantastic views and helpful staff. There is a gift shop and a coffee/drinks machine on site. There is parking available in a car park in the village but it’s hard to find so needs a parking sign as most people struggle to find it
Castle of Biron,Illan Dunne,5,Magnificent castle! Gorgeous views and very informative.
Castle Lassay,Jolanda Bolt,3,"Beautiful castle, that's still lived in. Not allowed to photograph (which was okay). But one pet peeve about French tourist attractions is the lack of English explanations. You're guided through the castle, which is great. The guide talked a lot but never translated anything in English (while he could speak English). We got a list of stuff we could see, but it only said: chest, XVIth century.  The guide obviously explained much, much more about it. So all this was wasted on us, which was a real pity. It doesn't have to be long, but just a little effort to try would make it much better. While I understand that not all castles can have guided tours by tablet like Chateau Guillaume-le-Conquérant in Falaise, even a longer handout would improve it or take the time to translate."
Castle Lassay,Katrina Hunt,5,What a fantastic day!! They really know how to make history come alive. The re-enactment groups who participated were particularly entertaining.
Castle Lassay,Gasgas,5,"We have been meaning to do the tour for months but so glad we did it's fantastic, we have admired it from outside for a long time and inside doesn't disappoint. The guide was a young lady who was great, it's in french but they give you a book in English so you can follow what's going on if you don't speak french.it really is quite spectacular, you get your tickets opposite the main castle door in a barn looking building that is a shop as well."
Castle Lassay,Stephen Childs,5,Access by guided tour only but reasonably priced. Tour was in French but booklets provided in English with most of the same info. Castle itself is impressive and very well maintained.
Castle Lassay,JP 'Free Burd',5,"Small rural village, beautiful surroundings and walks. Cafes and bars. The chateaux is spectacular,  a focal point for the locals and visitors. There is a large car park, 2 minute walk to the town. The car park also accomodates campervans.... you can top up your water tanks, empty your portable loos and even charge up your leisure batteries! Courtesy of Lassays town council. I love this but slightly biased as my dad lives there!"
Vajdahunyad Castle,Iva Drvarič,5,"We didn't go inside, but even just taking a walk around the castle (which by the way looks like something straight from a fairytale) was very nice. The castle is surounded by a beautiful park with a lake, which offers a lot of spots to just chill and enjoy the day"
Vajdahunyad Castle,Aleksandra Baranska,5,"This castle is a copy of a castle in Romania, and it contains parts of buildings of different architectural styles, so it's a bit of a mishmash :) However, this is very interesting and it's worth visiting. You can pay approximately £2 pp to visit the Apostles Tower and £1 pp to visit the Gatehouse Tower - both offer some views over the area. The castle houses the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, but we did not visit it as we preferred having a walk around."
Vajdahunyad Castle,Marva Klachko,5,"Love it! An amazing palace. Looks like Disney and drakulas home together. It had a lake nearbay and a music museum. The palace is amazing outside, inside a bit boring. Don’t miss that while your in budapest"
Vajdahunyad Castle,Antria Pappouta,5,"A beautiful park and a fairy-tale castle, where you will take nice pictures, take a leisurely walk, but you can also find different small kiosks for food or coffee."
Vajdahunyad Castle,Susa,5,"Breathtaking castle with agriculture museum inside. Very nicely located next to the Heros square and a big park, this castle looks amazing next to a lake. It looks like it is out of a fairy tale."
Château de Langeais,Lindy Lee,4,One of the few Chateaus that is dog friendly. You can take them inside and in the gardens. Smaller than the other grand chateaus though and simple garden. The entry wasn't step free. Also located in a cute town
Château de Langeais,Gusto Gironde,4,Beautiful park with impressive trees. The guided tour was very pleasant and the  hologram of Stephane Berne helped fixing the memory around d the wedding of Anne de Bretagne to King Charles VIII
Château de Langeais,Tanis Silbernagel,5,"This is my absolute favorite Château in all of the Touraine... not because of its magnificence, but because of it's charm. It's a sweet, small castle with a clandestine history."
Château de Langeais,Brenna Maawad,5,Great place to visit with charming good restaurants around (especially one right in front). Loved the indoor tour and reproduction of a historical wedding. Very interesting history.
Château de Langeais,Jurgita Jurgita,4,"Beautiful castle, one of many in this region. The town around is nice, with many cosy places in front of the caste."
Château des Milandes,Catherine Shawarby,5,"Some years since our previous visit, lots of positive changes. A really interesting chateau, newly renovated and open chapel, gardens with a variety of exotic birds. The brasserie is excellent and means more time to enjoy the place. The bird show is fun."
Château des Milandes,Fleur Gorsse,5,"Beautiful castle with an amazing insight into the unique life of Josephine Baker. Besides the opportunity to see the inside of the castle, there is a beautiful garden and a lovely bird show multiple times a day. Definitely a must to visit, if you are in the neighbourhood!"
Château des Milandes,Kevin De Valck,5,A very nice castle and gardens to visit. The entrance fee is not cheap but it is totally worth is. The bird show is interesting as well as the exotic animals. Very nice to visit with small children. The castle inside is also very nice with audio guide in different languages. But not that interesting for the smaller children's.
Château des Milandes,G Martin,5,"Lovely chateau with a very interesting history of Josephine Baker. If you don’t know about her, I urge you to look her up. A very thought provoking exhibition of her life and times with some of her beautiful costumes. Good restaurant onsite with sensible prices and beautiful gardens to walk through. Easy, plentiful parking including disabled spaces."
Château des Milandes,Kate Du Toit,5,"We had the most delightful, if somewhat warm visit. The children loved the bird show and were thrilled with the children’s audio tour. A fantastic day out"
Château de Pierrefonds,Ani Dragancheva,5,Incredible place to visit. You won't be disappointed with the castle. Tickets can be booked prior to visiting but also you can get them in the castle. The village by the castle is absolutely stunning and very nice full of little lovely bakeries and coffee shops. There is a lake surrounded by few restaurants (freshly cooked mussels and cheese board to enjoy with glas of wine) with fantastic views. You can also rent a pedalo to go around the lake and enjoy the view of the castle. Great day out!
Château de Pierrefonds,lisa beeckman,5,Loved this beautiful castle. I personally know it from the BBC show Merlin so I did not care much for the exhibited pieces but more about the exterior... They are still working on the outside of the castle so part of it is in scaffolding. (Said on a sign that they will be working on it up until dec '23)
Château de Pierrefonds,eva chan,5,"Not sure where you will find another medieval castle that looks just like those in your childhood fairytale books. Built in 12th Century onwards, owned by the Valois, and left in ruins from 17-18 century, it was bought by Napoleon and gradually restored. Some restoration detail might not be as historically accurate, but I am taking it all in. The Leopold I emperor of Belgium was married here it seems. The interior is left empty, but the tour is self guided, well labeled, and many areas are opened to the public. I think a casual day trip here with the family bringing picnic food is the way to go."
Château de Pierrefonds,Sarah Murray,5,Fantastic visit. Great castle to visit with kids. The roof architecture and fantasy shown through the metal work and interior decor was so interesting. Held the attention of our kid really well.
Château de Pierrefonds,Winter Bren,5,Beautiful castle under going extensive renovations but didn't take away from experience. Mainly wanted to see it because they filmed the BBC series Merlin here
Castle Roquetaillade,Jocelyne Chan,4,"Lovely castle, well restored. Guided tour was excellent. Unfortunately photos are not allowed inside because the owners still live in the castle.  Even in summer we had no crowds and plenty of parking."
Castle Roquetaillade,Tatyana Firth,5,"Visited today. A very beautiful site, amazing history, a very informative and entertaining tour of the castle! The surrounding area is very beautiful too!"
Castle Roquetaillade,Theresa Hoban,5,This is an amazing and beautiful castle. You must see this to believe with your own eyes the details and history of this lovely location. If you are fortunate enough to get a tour you will see the vibrant colors of the chapel and main castle. The setting will provide you with a good understanding of medieval defense systems and architecture. We had the lovely surprise ending of finding out who our tour guide was without his disguise ‼️‼️‼️ Do not miss this stop on your tour of Bordeaux 😍😍😍
Castle Roquetaillade,Kyle Lemmon,5,"Sebastian gave us a fantastic tour of the castle, and was extremely knowledgeable about everything inside. The interior is remarkably beautiful and meticulously maintained. Definitely worth a visit if you are in this part of France!"
Castle Roquetaillade,Alex Haas,5,"Came here on a friday afternoon, a nice (mostly) sunny day and expected a crowd of visitors. Only to find a single car in the unpaved (but free) parking lot. We didn't plan to go inside the castle, just take turns walk on the grounds and around the castle (we had our dog with, which was not allowed on the grounds). It is a very impressive sight, this castle. With the few clouds in the back it really made an eerie, atmospheric mood. The castle itself is very well maintained and taken care of. You could see the insides as well for a smaller fee. Surely a thing to do another time.  There are four smaller towers on each corner and a big center tower. A moat surround the whole castle. It's a castle as you would draw one when you're asked for. A ""typical"" (is there?) castle shape. Could be from a fairytale or a knight's movie.  There's also a very very nice old chapel on the grounds and you can also do some wine tasting in another building.  There's a big field in fron of the castle, great to make some nice pics. Across the roads is a huge vineyard, if you're interested in checking that one out. A very nice visit. And it's suprising why it's not more visited. Maybe it usually is, but on that day there were all together only a handful of visitors around."
Castle of Saint-Fargeau,Aline Noizet,5,"Great stop on my way back from holidays. Well preserved castle. It feels like we are back in medieval times. Really enjoyed the sceneries in each of the rooms. Really great job restoring the castle to give us an idea of how it was looking like. Don’t miss the roof frames, the winter room upstairs and the locomotives in the garden on your way to the lake. I didn’t attend the night show yet but it looks really amazing. Take some time to visit the surroundings of the castle too."
Castle of Saint-Fargeau,Dawn Norris,5,Wonderful medieval castle. The attic is particularly special as well as lovely grounds. Don’t miss the steam locomotives up the hill near the old hunting lodge.
Castle of Saint-Fargeau,Jörg Straub,5,The castle is beautifully decorated both outside and inside. The entire complex is very large and you should therefore take plenty of time to explore the building and the park in all their details. The best thing for me was the possibility to go up to the attic. The way the construction is made of wood is impressive. Definitely worth a visit!
Castle of Saint-Fargeau,ShanLucifan,4,"I didn't get to go inside because we got there too late, but it looked nice from the outside and there are some lovely restaurants and cafes right next to it."
Castle of Saint-Fargeau,ishpoint,5,"Still being renovated,looks like the owners gave themselves a decent task,but somehow saved the site.The guide is entertaining(if you understand french),the plus is the attic open to the public(not common in those kind of buildings)with the collection of ancient toys on display.The parc and garden(english style)are worth a walk too."
Menthon-Saint-Bernard Castle,Paul W,4,"Nice Chateau. Entry €11. You have to go around in a compulsory guided tour which takes an hour or so. Guide speaks in French only but English language pamphlets also available. The chateau rooms are small and tour groups are quite large so it feels a bit claustrophobic. Rooms are well furnished so it is interesting to see. The views of the lake are beautiful and almost worth the visit alone. Small cafe doing crepes and drinks, watch out for the ice cream as was full of flies on our visit. Also a small gift shop. Garden isn't really taken care of but there was no charge for entry. Free parking although the overspill parking we had to use was a bit of trek up the fill from the house itself. Worth a visit if you are in or around Annecy for sure!"
Menthon-Saint-Bernard Castle,Christina Fotinopoulou,4,"Beautiful place, worth the visit especially if you have kids! It can get crowded and if you do not speak French you need to read a couple of things in advance to be able to enjoy the visit. Tip: do not park in the first parking place you meet, there is one bigger further up, next to the entrance of the castle."
Menthon-Saint-Bernard Castle,Philippe Laurijssen,5,"Beautiful Castle with a lot of History. It's been in the family for centuries and they kept on enhancing and improving the castle with good maintenance. We had a great guided tour in English and saw many unique rooms with history and modern art. The castle has a panoramic view over the lake of Annecy and even has a shop for souvenirs as well as a little cafe. Great to spend 1,5-2hs of your afternoon. Back in the garden they keep peacock's, fun to watch. There are also toilet facilities and free parking."
Menthon-Saint-Bernard Castle,Jaren Rogers,5,Lovely castle with a wonderful view of the lake. The tour was in French but they answered our questions in English. The library was particularly stunning with books several hundred years old. Highly recommend!
Menthon-Saint-Bernard Castle,Roy Warman,4,"Lovely Chateau still occupied by the same family for 1,000 years. Only a small part is open using guided tours, but well worth it."
Vitré Castle,Jarrod Hunt,5,"For €6 entry and free for kids, you can't go wrong! Partly closed due to renovations, you can still access 75% of the castle. Well maintained and with very good period furniture and paintings, you'll really get a good sense of how the residents lived during medieval times."
Vitré Castle,Darya Maynes,5,"Lovely attraction to visit!  The displays in the castle are beautifully arranged and very interesting.  Not very accessible though - we had a stroller with us, and we had to take turns at going around the exhibits as there were steps everywhere (unless there is a lift / ramps that we didn't find)."
Vitré Castle,Globetrot With Mikalys,5,"A medieval castle erected in a small town called Vitré. Other than the preserved walls and towers, many artifacts are on display"
Vitré Castle,ap mul,5,I was only passing through on bike so I cannot give an honest opinion. But from the outside it looks like a typically beautifully built medieval French castle.
Vitré Castle,Ian Crockford,5,Impressive castle in the very impressive old town of Vitre. A great place to walk through history and grab something to eat and drink. A charming town with reasonable parking.
Najac Castle,Alex Haas,5,"This fortress/castle is one of the most impressive ones you will ever see. It's the location that makes it.  Sitting on a - at times steep - hill, you can see it from far away. And when you are walking down on the Rue Du Chateau (coming from the village), then it's just a sight to behold. It's picture-perfect.  It goes a good way down from the village....until it goes back up again to reach the castle. It's a fairly short walk - a lot shorter than it might seem.  If you have a stroller or a wheelchair it's quite an obstacle though. And the steep stairs and the cobble stones can get pretty slippery, even when it's not raining. So be aware of that and be careful.  We didn't go inside the castle - we had our Bulldog with. But the best sight of it isn't up-close anyways...it's on Rue Du Chateau when you walk towards it.  A wonderful, pretty and magical fortress. A must-see."
Najac Castle,Karen Cowell,5,We had a great time here. My husband was cycling to Najac so while we wandered around waiting for him we climbed all the way to the Château up the tiny roads. My two children had great fun running around the site discovering little alcoves and investigating open areas. The view is fantastic from all sides.
Najac Castle,Miranda Gambetti,5,"What a great trip! The hike up was not the easiest stroll, however many places to take a breather and see the views. From inside your can climb to the top- the spiral staircase are narrow, but worth the climb. You can see the town of Najac from each level and the secret passway is really fun. A great time!"
Najac Castle,Paul Hemmett,5,Stunning location views nice town definitely worth a visit
Najac Castle,AKi (buenas.barcelona),5,A great walk up to the castle. The view from the top is priceless.
Forteresse Royale de Chinon,Lindsey Reece-Smith,4,"We went here with children and it was a good experience for everyone and took much longer than expected, which was good compared to the times we have paid to go somewhere and finished in a short period of time. If you are booking on line you skip the queue but remember to ask for your free histopad. It is a small tablet which triggers as you walk to different parts of the fortress, shows what the view would have been 600 years ago, from where you are standing etc. For children there is also a sticker challenge and collecting treasures on the pad.  There are a lot of steps up and down the towers so go prepared for a good workout   although not shown on the website there is a cafe serving sandwiches, cake, drinks etc"
Forteresse Royale de Chinon,icegini,5,"This was one of the best places we went during our week around the Loire valley watching castles and so. From the beginning the place felt like interesting because of the lady at the reception explaining things, giving us a histopad which would allow us at certain points get a kind of video of how things might have been, I think in the fourteenth century (?) and provides you information, if you want to by clicking on the images. And it also had a treasure hunt integrated, which not only the kids had fun with! The fortress was big and is now mainly a ruin. But the place has been made/ kept in a way that you still can imagine the shape and grandness. The panorama from the towers, walls..is great. At several spots you can go with steps down inside the fortress and also walk through rooms. There is also in the middle a lot of grass with trees allowing for shadow and chairs are placed. A very nice outside kind if bar is available with also here very nice staff. The atmosphere in this place was so great and the staff as well."
Forteresse Royale de Chinon,Joshua Preece,5,A must visit. Beautiful castle. A interactive tablet is given to you upon entry. Fun for kids
Forteresse Royale de Chinon,Oana Leanca,5,"Very interesting castle, you can learn a lot about the life back in the day. The towers offer splendid views over the Chinon and the river and the courtyard is lovely, you can leisure on the grass or on the many chairs available."
Forteresse Royale de Chinon,Yori Schell,4,"Historically a very nice castle, with some reconstruction done. The app shows how things used to look like with lots of extra information to read. The castle is also partly in ruin and a lot of the original castle is gone, therefor no 5th star. But the defense towers, the clock tower, some ramparts and the reconstructed halls are still there and accessible. Ice cream, some food and drinks and toilet available on the grounds."
Castle Sailhant,Linda Bond,1,"Having just tried to visit, we were told the tour is only in French. We asked if we could just go in and look but we're refused. What would it take to print some information in English to give out and enable English speaking visitors to take the tour too? Perhaps they just don't like English visitors!"
Castle Sailhant,Trevor Bond,1,Customer service not good if you don't speak French don't bother. They obviously don't like tourists
Castle Sailhant,Rits Baneke,2,The castle is a beautiful building. The surroundings are astonishing. The interior is really horrible. Tasteless and with no feeling of the European heritage so called restauration. I hope the owner will take some interest in the France history and stops to draw stones on the walls… the guide was nice and patient.
Castle Sailhant,Maite,1,"Terrible customer service! My husband and I were turned away after a 30 minute wait at the door because there happened to be a coach load visit. Even though it was only the two of us, staff would not budge and were totally unsympathetic and inconsiderate. We had come a long way and had our covid passes and monies ready.  I would strongly recommend checking in advance to avoid disappointment or going somewhere else where your interest and money are appreciated."
Castle Sailhant,Al Cowie,5,"Great tour, wonderful quiet village, and the castle has been restored in a wonderfully sympathetic way by the owner, an expert in historic restorations, for his own enjoyment, which he has kindly decided to open up to the public."
Josselin Castle,James White,4,"Beautiful château, unfortunately we could only see the grounds and ground floor of the property. You can visit much more, but a guided tour is needed. Sadly, we did not have time for this."
Josselin Castle,Yosi Raz,3,The castle is very beautiful from the outside and much less so from the inside. The doll museum contains simple dolls. It is not recommended to enter the doll museum. The cost to enter the castle is 10 euros. I don't think it's recommended to enter.
Josselin Castle,Floriska Mustiere,4,A gem to visit in a nice little town. I would recommend the guided tour if you want to learn more about the history of the castle and region.
Josselin Castle,Damien Phelan,5,"Josselin is simply a Town out of the 16th Century together with Castle, Quaint cobble streets, 16th century wooden frame dwellings, alongside a beautiful river and canal with cafes and Restaurants alike.... beautiful and picturesque"
Josselin Castle,Tom Bell,5,"Lovely castle and grounds to visit!  We came as a family in the summer, the castle and house has plenty to look at and see, with activities for the kids. Everything is well kept/restored to a high quality.  The grounds offer lots of private paths and things to explore. Perfect places for a picnic.  Highly recommended!"
Château de Saint-Ulrich,Maxime,5,"Nice castle accessible with a easy hike (though a bit steep at some point) from Ribeauvillé.  Despite quite many part are broken, the castle is still quite big.  You can visit many rooms and it’s possible to go on top of the tower to admire the view on Alsace."
Château de Saint-Ulrich,Oryza Tarigan,5,"Old castle with beautiful view to Ribeauville. From the top of the castle, we can view the Ribeauville in a whole. This castle can be reached by hiking. The passsahe is quite challenging though. There is two alternative ways: from the park spot, you can either go left or right. Both need time around 1 hour to finish. The left way is quite rocky and steep but you can see the vineyard along your journey. The right way is more sloping and you can visit Castle Giersberg before you arrive at Saint-Ulrich (it's near though, around 200 metres apart). Prepare your body, we should have a better physique since we need to take a quite long walk."
Château de Saint-Ulrich,Kseniia Tavrina,5,Nice not exhausting hike ( appr 40 mins) and pleasant views. Free exit.
Château de Saint-Ulrich,Dots 99,5,"Lovely hiking above the Ribeauville village! We started from a small road near the parking and playground and we followed the ""+"" mark on the path. The distance until the two main castles is 7km (we did it in around 1hour ) and I would recommend athletic shoes and a lot of water. Both of the lower castles were nice, the first one had amazing views of the village and of the second one, whereas the second one (Chateau de Saint Urlich) was  bigger and more interesting to explore. On our way down we chose a different path, starting from the second castle and we basically followed the red signs until the point where we initially started at the parking."
Château de Saint-Ulrich,Serge Kovacs,5,"Beautiful ruined castle Well worth the climb.... Don't take the direct route unless you have mountain goat DNA. From the parking lutzelbach in ribeauville count about 30 intense walking minutes, or 50 less intense. Note that there are 2 more castles... One around the corner, the other one even further up hill!"
Castle of Roquefixade,Marek Michalik,5,"Wow, the view is spectacular. Just be mindful which hiking rout you take, it took as ages to walk up. The stairs although steep are berer choice."
Castle of Roquefixade,Jørn S.,5,What a beautifull place in front offen the Pyrenen. You can hike around this old Chateau in 2 houres or climb at the entry of this walk.
Castle of Roquefixade,George Novak,4,"Nice views from the top,well worthy of steep walk up.Unfortunately upper part of the castle is closed for public."
Castle of Roquefixade,Miriam Oro,5,"Worth going to this place, natural beauty with amazing landscape from the top."
Castle of Roquefixade,Phil Corbett,5,Gentle climb and well worth it.
Château de Rochebonne,Bracin K,5,An amazing drive through the forest with stunning views. This castle ruins is isolated and a great hike. In the summer it can be very warm. A castle of a 10th century crusader. He would know you were coming! The views are incredible. Highly recommend.
Château de Rochebonne,Efiltrops,5,"Worth the visit!  You could park the car above the ruïnes. After a short but very steep walk you could explore the ruïnes of Rochebonne. In the last decades they did some restorations to increase the safety (however they did not restore too much), but you should still watch out for yourself. Next to the castle a beautiful waterfall could be found."
Château de Rochebonne,Jens Nicolay,3,"Nice visit, but not that much to see. Especially nice for children 6--12 to clamber around. Don't forget to visit the nearby waterfall."
Château de Rochebonne,Gabriel Van Houten,4,"Beautiful view, not much caste left but a cool site nonetheless."
Château de Rochebonne,Lou Di rucko,5,"Cool place, beautiful view, waterfall"
Hunaudaye Castle,Nedercup,5,Its a beautiful ruin of a castle that dates back to the 13 century. The ambiance is very relaxed. The information about the castle is available in many languages. The inner courtyard is a very nice place to relax. They even supply costumes for the kids while visiting.
Hunaudaye Castle,Carol Ramsell,5,Lovely place with drawbridge intact! Good picnic areas as well...overlooking either the lake and moat or marvellous open land with trees and many birds of prey 😋😋
Hunaudaye Castle,S O'Reilly,1,Very disappointed. Arrived having driven over 1hr to get here. Their credit card machine was not working so we were turned away 😬 as we had no cash on us.  We moved to Central Brittany a year ago and had researched the castle and were looking forward to our visit. Thankfully there are many other places to visit in Brittany.
Hunaudaye Castle,M Gowen,5,"A really unexpected surprise. We visited this place on a drizzly day not expecting much more than a little walk around a ruin. From the very courteous lady in the shop, to the visible care they'd put into the different rooms in the tower, to the truly astonishing spiral staircase (worth the entrance fee in itself), we had a really nice 90 minute visit."
Hunaudaye Castle,Ewan Scobie,4,"A beautiful castle with stunning views, the exhibits are interesting and there's is loads to explore! The highest tower isn't for those who fear hights !"
Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte,Oksana Sukhenko,5,There is a lot of decor elements in very good condition. The interior light also creats a magic atmosphere of XVIII century. The audio guide is a good accompaniment to the visit and it's not boring at all. However the most impressive part is a kitchen of the chateau. There is also restaurant and bar zone on the chateau area. Highly recommended to plan your visit for candles night pick nick during summer time.
Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte,Olivia,5,"How there are not more visitors at this chateau is completely beyond me, it is unquestionably superior to so many of the larger chateaus that receive more visitors. It is such a marvel of architecture and the way it compliments the gardens is perfection. The inside of the house is full of history with a good tour.  A walk to the Hercules statue is an absolute must and not too far. The view from the statue down over the chateau is incredible and really gives perspective.  The little kiosk outside does lovely crepes as well!"
Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte,Barbara H,5,"Beautiful house with a fascinating but sad history. A lot of passion went into planning this house and gardens. We spent an extra 5 euros to go up to the dome where we could look out. I recommend this if you are agile. The spiral staircase to the top is narrow. My mom is 85 and she did it, though. Spectacular views at the top."
Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte,John Simons,4,Beautiful private owned  Chateau . We arrived about 7pm for a candle lit fireworks display. We were on our way back  from Fontainebleau so we were a bit worn out to be honest . Worth a visit but long wait till 11pm for fireworks display.
Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte,Suzanne Paul,5,"Superb in every way. Well organised, a well designed, self-guided tour of the chateau and gardens. Fascinating details of the genesis of the gardens and the collaboration of three fine artists in their fields of design and art to realise this monumental masterpiece. Cafes serving excellent food and an Aladdin's cave of goods for sale in the gift shop."
Château Royal de Blois,Sasha,5,"Wonderful!  Simply exceptional, first of all because of its beauty, very well preserved and converved and I am grateful for that, but also for the multitude of exhibits inside the castle.  It is incredible to get to know the lives of these people who made a living not only from books but also by visiting the places where they lived.  It is an interesting place for adults and children"
Château Royal de Blois,Richard Bastien,5,Interesting castle. Interesting to see and understand all the changes done to the building and the architecture trough the age. This castle has been the central scene of an important turning point in the French history at the end of the XVIth century in the struggle between Catholics and Protestants. One of ours room is dedicated to this event. The visit with the interactive tablet is just perfect.
Château Royal de Blois,Margaret Pooh,4,"With a very unique design of spiral shape staircases and a combination of four different kind of construction styles from different times, the chateau presents a lovely looking. Parking there can make you headache. The underground parking lot is recommended. But do remember your slots and the exit you use. I got lost there😂 after the chateau, the royal garden is another nice place to visit. On a sunny day, with a few friends and probably your dog, definitely a nice little walk will make the day better!"
Château Royal de Blois,icegini,4,A very big and beautiful chateau where you can wander through the different rooms see the beautiful decorations. Also the architectural part is really amazing.
Château Royal de Blois,Ian Walshaw,5,An excellent former Royal chateau overlooking the town of Blois and the Loire River. Plenty to see giving good value for the admission price. Some younger people may not find it particularly interesting unless they are studying French history (back stories of the French monarchy for the less well educated)
Royal Castle of Collioure,Matt T,4,"Castel Royale is an incredibly well preserved piece of history with so much to explore. The views across Collioure are incredible.  It’s priced really well (€14 for a family of four). It to us 2-3 hours to get round with a free map/guide provided in multiple languages. The toilets are clean and free.  The only negative is that there is very little on show within the castle, most of the rooms are bare, so there is little to look at or read. There is also no cafe."
Royal Castle of Collioure,Henrik Haugberg,4,"In interesting and exciting surroundings on historical grounds, but in many of the rooms there is only empty space and not even information about what the room was used for or when it was built. There is potential to improve the experience for visitors."
Royal Castle of Collioure,Jo Hobday,5,"Beautiful place to visit, especially the view (and breeze) from the top. Children loved it, a particular like were the, what looked like, coloured glass windows."
Royal Castle of Collioure,Adrian Somerville,5,Amazing place! We visited from Australia! So much history and great views from the top! Highly recommended!
Royal Castle of Collioure,Sky Cooke-Roberts,5,Such a beautiful and historical chateau with amazing views. Entry fees are very reasonable. Very interesting short film going on at the moment - loved this.
Château of Vincennes,Sebastian Rousseau,5,"Beautiful castle, full of history and well managed. The Chapel is worth a visit with a stunning embroidered tree. I thoroughly recommend a visit."
Château of Vincennes,Ahmed Khan,5,Tickets are cheap with kids go free. Can easily spend half a day. Well worth the visit if you are in Paris
Château of Vincennes,Rob Vince,4,"We were staying near Disneyland and also seeing Paris. This chateau made a great break from the crowds, easy location halfway into Paris on the RER train line. Huge and a bit neglected but the chapel and keep were impressive. Also recommend the audio guide."
Château of Vincennes,Jennifer Smith,1,So overrated!! I don’t understand how people rave about this place: even the cashier told me there’s no exhibits to see inside the doujon. So you’re paying €9.50 to climb an empty tower and then see a modern installation in a barren church?!  Have these visitors never traveled before?! The courtyard is pretty desolate and nearly no buildings are open. The one that is has a boring sounding exhibition on arms that was closed anyway this Saturday.  Would never recommend this place TBH. Somewhat of a wasted day trip from Paris.
Château of Vincennes,Allan,5,Pretty castle located near a very beautiful park. Tickets are required for the tower and the church and can be bought inside the castle grounds. Expect to spend around 2 hours max here.
Château d'Angers,AieshaB01,5,"Absolutely loved this beautiful chateau fort. There is a lot to see, especially the Tapestry of the Apocalypse based on the Book of Revelations. The views of the city are stunning too. There is a lovely outdoor café to chill during the visit."
Château d'Angers,icegini,5,"A very big, beautiful castle to visit at Angers with a lot of history. We first visited the castle and had a drink next to the gardens, which was very relaxing. The steps upwards allow you to walk around on the wall towers, which is so beautiful and big. It gives you a wonderful view over the river and the rest of the castle. The castle and chapel inside are really nice and the apocalypse exhibition is wonderful."
Château d'Angers,Judy Hung,5,"I got into Angers only at 8pm, so the castle has closed for the day. It’s still a beautiful sunset visit, to learn about the medieval historical from the bilingual demonstration outside the castle. It’s right next to the Maine river with beautiful garden with majestic castle towers. Even just observing the renovation of the castle, I’m in awe!"
Château d'Angers,Phil Bradford,4,"Interesting fortress, with striking towers and commanding riverside setting. The northern side was under scaffolding this visit (I have previously been when it was possible to see more of the ramparts), so not everything was open. There is not a huge amount inside, but there are stunning views and even for those like me not that interested in such things, the medieval tapestry was stunning. The inside of the central ‘keep’ has interesting displays and is well set up for children with interactive displays. There is plenty of space to run around outside, but most of the external towers and ramparts are off limits, which reduces some of the fun of exploring a castle!"
Château d'Angers,Marcia S,5,The Chateau is great to spend 2-3 hours exploring its history and admiring the architecture. The Apocalypse Tapestry is also a  worthwhile look to admiring the craftsmanship of the tapestry. I would recommend anyone of all age groups to visit.
Pirou Castle,Renee Iseson,5,Well worth a visit. Guided tours in French but was given an English guide book to take along on our self guided tour which was quite nice. You can easily spend an hour and half here in the morning and have enough time to linger and read all the info plaques. A similar tapestry to the Bayeux Tapestry is housed here and is just as lovely.
Pirou Castle,adrian burt,4,Viking village event. The ambience of the chateau is quite magical. Best visited when it is less busy. When they organise big events the parking provisions are inadequate
Pirou Castle,MagicBusArt,5,Fantastic place to visit with family. I highly recommend.☘️An interesting heritage centre with a souvenir shop.
Pirou Castle,Gavin Beard,5,"A pleasant little castle worth a quick visit if passing by. The long history is interesting, with its coaching fortunes through the centuries. Instant rampart walk as well."
Pirou Castle,Gill C,5,"A wonderful moated 12th century castle,  restored this century from a ruin. €7 closed Tuesday. Most of the castle is accessible, living rooms, kitchen, cider press etc. The towers and roof have great views. The old lodgings give a good feeling of how it was to live here. Amazing tapestry (in the style of Bayeaux) shows the history of the castle and its fortunes and fall. Definitely worth a visit."
Château de Quéribus,Simon Giles,5,Stunning scenery which will take your breath away. Quite a drive up a winding and sometimes narrow road. It was 36c on the day we went so the walk from the car park to the castle was pretty tough. However a beautiful and historic location which is well worth a visit.
Château de Quéribus,Rebecca Norbury,5,"Fantastic experience, car park close buy, 10-15 minute walk up the the castle"
Château de Quéribus,T K,5,"If you're wearing a hat, good luck keeping your lid on. Squeribus is the name of the wind from the north."
Château de Quéribus,Maria Slovakova,5,"I love going up to this castle. There is a lot of magic in the air here. If you in the area, it is a must."
Château de Quéribus,R D (Ron0509),5,"One of the must do’s in the regio! Amazing history in a very tempting nature, what a landscape!"
Château de Montségur,Éamon M,3,"The walk is pretty steep, but if you are a backpacker that came on foot from Lavelanet, then this additional part should feel like a reasonably-paced epilogue (unless you have run out of water on your way to the castle). There's little information available in English on the signs, so if you came here to read about the Cathars, be prepared to polish your French. As is often the case with high-altitude places, the view alone is worth the struggle.  I must say the place doesn't feel particularly mystical, excluding the atmosphere of remoteness that its relative altitude creates. Guess that has to do with it having a more boring history after 1244"
Château de Montségur,Sören Dähnrich,4,"Small Ruin of a cathartic castle, historical wise very interesting. About the ruin is not that much to see, what amaze me is that there were living up to 600 people on the rock. The view over the surrounding land is amazing, the way up is a bit challenging for a couch potato but do able. Take water and sturdy shoes with you."
Château de Montségur,Hunter Purvis,5,Beautiful medieval castle full of history. The museum and town below are also lovely. Loved the view from the top after a tough but rewarding hike!
Château de Montségur,andor szabados,5,"Beautiful chatue, situated right on the top of the hill. The hike is manageable, it takes around 30 minutes with easy steps going up. The view from the top it is really beautiful, as you can see all around."
Château de Montségur,Johnny M,5,The castle isn't much to see but you go here for the view and history. There was a great guide (in french) explaining the story of the castle and the end of the cathars ... when I get back home I'll fire up medieval 1212AD and bring back the Cathars !!
Charming Rooftop and Sea View,Elodie MARQUES,5,"We recommend this cozy little nest, cute as you wish, very clean and super tropezienne terrace with the jacuzzi to enjoy a nice romantic moment."
Charming Rooftop and Sea View,Frédéric Fouache,5,Look no further to spend a pleasant weekend... Really on top
Charming Rooftop and Sea View,esteves gt,4,great
Museum for European Garden Art,stefan kebbekus,4,Very nice place
Museum for European Garden Art,Nikolaj Popravka,5,I’m sorry
Museum for European Garden Art,Sun arrow,5,An amazing place !!!
Museum for European Garden Art,Татьяна Столяренко,5,"Honestly, the museum is so-so. Of course there is something to see. Paintings, figurines, videos. Liked porcelain figurines and gnomes. The territory is not small, everywhere there are signs. There is even a patio with plants. The museum opposite was a huge surprise!"
Museum for European Garden Art,Edward von Flottwell,5,"Fine museum on the history of garden arts. There are many interesting things to discover, the focus is on stately gardens, but kitchen gardens, special plants and cultural interactions are also considered. The tour through the old buildings is an experience on top of that. I liked it, the only thing missing from a few showcases with architectural models is what you see there. The staff was really nice. You should plan two hours for the visit."
Gnandstein Castle,Aaron Robinson,5,"A beautiful castle that is worth a visit. The staff of the cafe inside the castle were dressed in medieval style which added to the ambiance. All the staff in the castle are warm and friendly. The surroundings invite you to take a romantic look back and imagine how this historic castle may have felt in earlier times. There is a tunnel and fortifications to explore and the museum is a must! There are a lot of rooms on multiple levels to explore, including a 500 year old chapel. There are many interesting artifacts on display throughout the castle. There is also a game room with interactive games (very entertaining)! The tower Keep is currently closed, so we have a good reason to revisit the castle again when that reopens! We found that there was still plenty to see even though the Keep was closed so don't hold back on a visit in the meantime if you haven't yet been here. Many thanks to the staff who made our visit to the castle even better. We enjoyed this visit very much and already look forward to our next visit when the tower Keep is reopened! The woods surrounding the castle are also worth a hike."
Gnandstein Castle,Fred Dreiling,4,"Pretty outside, interesting cellar but did not go into the museum. Walked around the castle in the woods..."
Gnandstein Castle,Tersia Voigt,5,Food were delicious! And so friendly staff.
Gnandstein Castle,Ayman Farouk Said,5,It’s not a large castle but it’s in a nice size It allows you to see how old German rich families were living It was a castle that destroyed then later converted to a palace Nice to visit 😉
Gnandstein Castle,Ryan,5,Beautiful castle.  We got married here.  Great food and beer in the restaurant.
Marienburg Castle,Matt W,4,"Definitely a beautiful castle and very well maintained. Tour was okay. More information about the castle throughout the tour, in addition to the family/building of it would have been nice. I wish we could have seen more- there was so much locked down but more rooms and more of the grounds with the good views would have really improved the experience.  That being said, the parts that were completed are awesome and it’s definitely worth the trip"
Marienburg Castle,Anuradha Samankumari,4,Absolutely beautiful castle 🏰. If you love to visit castle you must go there. It’s really worth to buy a ticket to visit inside. You can buy tickets by online. A lot of paintings on the wall. The restaurant has really good and tasty foods. I highly recommended this place to visit.
Marienburg Castle,Annette Raju,4,"Beauty awaits at the hilltop. Castle is situated at the peak, surrounded by trek trails and good roads for vehicle drive. Restaurant adjacent to the castle also added to the castle flavour. Decent choices of food. Castle is worth visiting. Quite portion of the castle is open for the tourists to enter. Tickets price is reasonable. One can view the sugarcane farm and adjacent water body to relax"
Marienburg Castle,A Google User,5,"This place is perfect! Amazing castle with nice views. History of this place is really romantic and full of love. Inside of the castle are lots of pictures, things of art, small details, antique furniture"
Marienburg Castle,4AB (4andrius),5,"Great castle to visit - walkthru exposition over 2 floors. We visited as family of 4 for 40€ ticket. Saw many rooms, hallways, staircases and read some interesting facts. Marienburg castle is worth a visit! 😁"
Schlosshotel Weilburg,Michel Brebsom,4,"Very nice location, good service, breakfast buffet.  The furniture in my room was a bit old and out of fashion, and so was the bathroom. But everything was very clean and cosy.  The room had no air-conditioning which means it can become rather hot in summer.  Good WiFi coverage."
Schlosshotel Weilburg,Christine Weißbrich,3,"Nice &modern room, but not very clean.(spots on glass doors); The shower not very comfortable. Friendly staff, great breakfast. Extremely long ways to rooms."
Schlosshotel Weilburg,Andrei Luca,5,"As the name already suggests, this is a former castle. The hotel occupies the lower part of the castle (where the guests rooms and the stables used to be in the past). The upper part is the actual castle, which can be visited (entry fee required). The hotel has a lot of fun activities: table tennis, pool table, fitness room, sauna, swimming pool, german bowling (Kegeln), smoking lounge, TV room with large couches. Most of the rooms have a view towards the river. The rooms at the base floor have actually 2 levels: the first one looks rather like a guest room, while the bedroom is upstairs. The rooms on the upper levels are smaller and have smaller windows, which are protected by a glass panel in front, so kids won't fall out. Food is great at their restaurant and they have a lot of home brewed liquors. You can even buy some as souvenirs."
Schlosshotel Weilburg,Jens Thomas,4,Very cozy place. A nice change from the ultra modern hotels. Great view from the room over the river. Free parking and breakfast are nice perks.
Schlosshotel Weilburg,Martin Wie,5,We stayed here for over a week.  Nice and friendly staff.  The hotel is very nice . Not ask rooms have ac. You must ask for it in summer.
Schloss Braunfels,Joanna Sapik,5,"Very interesting and wonderful place, you can visit the castle with a guide.  Beautiful old village under the castle."
Schloss Braunfels,Danny Marvels,5,"Amazing Castle with such a rich history. It is absolutely worth the trip. The family's treasure room is a must and it's only 4 Euros. They also have a Café inside where they sell souvenirs and tickets for guided tours. You can also get an English manual. There are several parking spots around the castle, and it's not far too walk up, but it's definitely steep and not really wheelchair friendly. The village in front of the building has beautiful shops and restaurants so it's easy to spend a day around it."
Schloss Braunfels,Mandy Bogle,5,"Amazing, the most beautiful castle I have been to, would definitely recommend"
Schloss Braunfels,Tanvir Morshed,5,Such a magnificent gothic style castle from middle age. The view is amazing and the guided tour was pretty interesting. Even the town center was such a beautiful place. A visit is highly recommended!!
Schloss Braunfels,Suzette L,5,"Amazing tour, great story teller!"
Glücksburg Castle,Kristina Majaj,5,"Beautiful place to visit with family. We paid the family ticket, which was affordable for 6. Many beautiful things to see inside and have a pleasant walk around the castle."
Glücksburg Castle,Pharadeon “Pharadeon”,5,"This castle is definitely worth a visit. We were there in the winter season so there weren’t really a lot of tourists. The water in the surrounding lake was quite still so you could see the reflection of the castle which was quite magical. You can also buy tickets for 6€ to go inside the castle, but for us, the outer view was enough as we were just passing by anyway."
Glücksburg Castle,Sofia Suhorska,5,"Tickets price was normal, not too expensive Really beautiful castle with interesting atmosphere It can be good for date , because you immerse yourself in a romantic medieval atmosphere"
Glücksburg Castle,Philipp Fabrizius,2,"Nice Castle, interesting history's about the danish and Schleswig-Holstein war.  Missing in some areas info's about the exhibited pieces. (Actual Panels with written information on it)  Who like's a audio guidance - this is your place.  Nevertheless, only two stars awarded for the disgusting rudeness of the lady guardian from the second floor."
Glücksburg Castle,Anne-Marije Kraijnbrink,4,Nice Schloss to visit. They had an interesting collection of artifacts and various activities for kids as well. The mannequins are a bit scary though. They either look like the Beatles or poor western actors hahaha!
Stolzenfels Castle,Slavomir Olsovsky,4,"A very romantic castle definitely worth of 4 hours of your time. The parking house in the village on the other hand is so tiny only the best drivers will get in, park and get out. Give yourself a medal when you'll leave without a scratch;-)."
Stolzenfels Castle,Sameera Kulsum,5,"Beautiful view, and the route is great almost 1.5 km walk slope is gentle and well maintained. If you want to go by car then it's great  you can take car to the top and front of castle 🏰.  This castle is renovated with beautiful infrastructure. They cost 5€ per person and they also tour (in German only)"
Stolzenfels Castle,Ammarah Masroor,4,"The palace is located on a hill which means you need to hike all the way up. If you are into steep walking/hiking and do not want to click pictures in between then you can easily reach in 15 mins. However, if you don't hike usually and would also like to click some pictures along the way then it would take around 25 mins.  The tickets to the castle are for 5 euros which can be paid either by cash or card. There the person is going to tell you to wait at the gallery for the guided tour as soon as you enter. Keep in mind that you are only able to access the interior of the castle with the guided tour as the guide has keys to the rooms otherwise the doors are locked and you can only explore the outer garden and balconies. Taking pics inside is not allowed and the tour takes around 20 to 25 mins. Do remember to ask for an English brochure at the entrance if you don't speak German so that you can read the description for the rooms in it while getting the tour.  Also there are no eating options available next/inside the castle as it is situated in between a hiking trail."
Stolzenfels Castle,Claudia,4,"Went in May 2023. Great to see the castle, its gardens and views! So it was totally worth it!  I don't have car, but it was easy to go from Koblenz to Stolzenfeld by bus (30/30min, a trip about 15min).  The way from the streets to the castle is easy (they have pavement and stairs, with tracks as alternative), but I don't recommend for people with disability. But you can reach the castle by car.  5€ as entrance fee when I went. You can enter the castle,see its surroundings and views by yourself. You can't go into the rooms inside without a guide. When inside, you can't take pictures, and have to use the huge slippers they give to you.  What I didn't liked was the staff. The reception just gave me a panmphlet and said ""go fast, the tour is starting"", without explaining anything. I reached a group with a guide already explaining everything only in German. So I didn't know how anything worked (if I could walk without him, if it had english tours). In the middle of the inside tour I asked the guide about english tour, but he affirmed in a unpolite way that they don't have and that's why I received the pamphlet. Only then I saw that I could find some numbers and follow the rooms to read reaally brief explanations, shorter than what the guide provides.  In the end, really liked the castle, the gardens, the views and surroundings. Didn't like the tour inside the rooms, but still worth the visit!"
Stolzenfels Castle,Carl Niclas,4,"While the Stolzenfels castle is impressive and is perched ominously over the Rhine, it competes with so many other ruins and castles in the area."
Schloss Hämelschenburg,Thomas Carsjens,5,"It is nice to see that a privately owned castle has preserved a part of the original interior and that guided tours are offered to tourists. The guide was a very friendly woman and she told about the history of the castle with great passion. The tour costs: - €11,- for adults - €8,- for kids from 14 years old and students - €5,50 for kids between 5 and 13 years old - Free for kids younger than 5 years old. The tour takes around 50 minutes. I recommend to visit the castle and to take a tour as you get to know the interesting history of the castle and its inhabitants."
Schloss Hämelschenburg,Will Gruber,5,"Beautiful 16th century castle with a very rich history, as well as the oldest surviving Protestant church in Europe! The grounds are still inhabited and maintained by the original family as a labor of love, and they recently completed a restoration of the entire castle exterior while taking great care to preserve as much of the original material and architecture as possible.  The current owners have also dedicated much of their time to ensuring that the castle can be sustainably maintained for future generations, and have even added a small hydroelectric dam to the old sawmill to power the grounds. Very much worth a visit, and should be considered as a model of both cultural preservation and sustainability!"
Schloss Hämelschenburg,don felton,4,"Always a pleasure to visit the Restaurant, beside the Schloss. Plenty of space, good coffee and goosgogs with a yummy  creamy crusty topping. (I don't know if it is Besai) whatever it is it tastes good. Not busy, plenty of space, excellent views and easy parking."
Schloss Hämelschenburg,Daniela Marks,5,"Beautiful castle with a nice little tour in a quaint setting, if you are not bothered by the road leading basically through it."
Schloss Hämelschenburg,Alexius K,5,Beautiful castle with easy parking and restaurant. An architecture of the castle is great. Quite and relaxing place.
Pfalzgrafenstein Castle,Ebin Zacharias,5,"Never intended to go here but accidentally saw this nice castle on the way to Cochem! It’s really nice and the historical importance quite excited the overall experience. I’m only sad that, I spent very less amount of time here. That’s when I thought to write a review about this castle. Do visit :)"
Pfalzgrafenstein Castle,Cornelia Kunze,5,"Must see! Stop and take the small ferry boat. Listen to the stories of the great captain Johnny, kids can chase the ghost in the small castle. And enjoy wonderful views!"
Pfalzgrafenstein Castle,carlos MsGr,5,Super singular
Pfalzgrafenstein Castle,L J,4,"many castles along the rhine, and didn't go in this one actually. Looks nice from outside"
Pfalzgrafenstein Castle,Sanjeevani Waghmare,5,Beautiful view from the castle.
Trausnitz Castle,Pietro Dell' Erba,5,"Best View of Landshut it's here! Accessibile via Long stairway, it's Just 10 minutes walk from Old Town. A must if you are in Landshut!"
Trausnitz Castle,Anthony,4,Cool place. Costs money to tour. Was pretty packed with people on the weekend.
Trausnitz Castle,Euderl Laryea,5,It takes about 10 to 13mins by foot from Altstadt to get to the Burg Trausnitz. Beautiful scenery of Landshut from the top of the castle and a garden.
Trausnitz Castle,Carsten M. Steffen,5,"Insanely beautiful place, starts with the walk from the parking lot through a park and then into the castle area. Highly recommended."
Trausnitz Castle,Lou Fegans,4,"Parking: there are 20 parking spots right at the entrance to the castle, take the gravel road through a series of tower walls to reaching the parking, alternatively you can park in the park and walk 5-10minutes. We visited on a feast day when the museum was very very crowded but there was still empty parking right at the castle. Duration: 1hr. Good quality museum with lots of artifacts and then large rooms. Note the castle had a fire in 1961 and as a result there is very little original artwork and stucco."
Ludwigsburg Residential Palace,Hannah Markham,5,Had the most amazing morning exploring the grounds of this palace. It was during December and I think because it was winter we didn’t have to pay any entrance fees. The palace also wasn’t open to go inside. But it had snowed and the gardens were just beautiful.
Ludwigsburg Residential Palace,Ali AlMusawi,5,"Amazing guided tour, very informative and entertaining. The castle has been kept in an excellent condition. The ticket is separate than the surrounding garden which is joyful for if you have kids."
Ludwigsburg Residential Palace,Bryce Gething,4,If you enjoy historical tours this one is fairly quick and reasonably priced. The guide in English was very knowledgeable. Note that you can only do the tour at certain times of day. I recommend going through the gardens as well which needs several hours to explore.
Ludwigsburg Residential Palace,Brian Planchard,3,"The gardens are lovely, the palace, at least the interior, is not. It is fairly dilapidated and compares poorly with other comparable palaces (Nymphenburg, Schonnbrun). You can see the interior only through a (somewhat infrequent) guided tour, which only covers the Duchess’ side and which doesn’t allow photos. My tour guide was not nice and not terribly informative. All in all, this was not the greatest stop on my tour of southern Germany."
Ludwigsburg Residential Palace,Ericka Bastias,4,"Really interesting Residential, we paid for the tour and it was entertaining. We also visited the gardens (there’s an extra fee for that) would recommend more to visit once it’s spring or summer. It can be very entertaining for kids since they have sets for different classical fairytales."
Schloss Weesenstein,The real Pit,4,"The Castle itself is a very big building, the good part is the internal court and the garden.  It is not what people expect when talking about a But at least is free to visit (except for the museum)."
Schloss Weesenstein,John K,5,"Really interesting museum. Includes descriptions of the family that has lived there and many uses of old accomodation or furniture. Lots of rooms and a lot of entertaining games like an air cannon, laser crossbow, a virtual knight horse fight, etc. It suits the younger and older audience very nicely. A beatiful garden, restaurants and caffee's. 5 stars"
Schloss Weesenstein,Sylwana Sikorska-Kupis,5,A place where one can meet the history and even try interactive horseriding as a knight 👍 really nice schloss cafe audioguide available
Schloss Weesenstein,Michał Lewinski,5,"Well, I have to admitt that this castle was a nice surprise. I thought that after two corridors of rooms which entrace was  sealed by glass, the tour would end, but it turned out that it barely started. There are many rooms on a few floors to explore including the attic which I have not seen in any other castles before. And believe me, I have seen many of them 😃 It is definitely worth visiting, especially when the garden is green so you could enjoy a walk after the tour."
Schloss Weesenstein,Julian Kobelt,5,Wonderful medieval castle with a fascinating history. The winter gardens are especially beautiful. Several cafes and restaurants on site. Plenty of free parking at the bottom and only a short walk up hill to the Castle. Would definitely recommend a visit to anyone touring in the area.
Altena Castle,Glodan Mircea,5,"No words to describe the beauty of this castle. So well preserved and with acces to most of the rooms... Also the access to the elevator from the tunnel is simply amazing. The elevator was 4.9 Euro per person,but worth every scent."
Altena Castle,Larisa Conchi,5,"the castle is very beautiful and the entrance is accessible to everyone, but all the exhibits are only described in German, it would be very good if they were also in English for tourists!"
Altena Castle,1 2,5,"The castle has been well preserved for centuries. The castle has a good location and beautiful scenery. In addition, it has a rich collection, such as medieval weapons, armor and animal specimens. Now it seems to be free of charge."
Altena Castle,Atiq Massan,5,"One of the most beautiful castles I've ever been to and is a very practical castle meant for practical purposes. Location is super easy bus and lift from center city, both good but you see a lot by bus. See their kitchen, how towers are made livable. Has a very nice restaurant with good assortment of food. super nice staff always smiling at you and guiding. Though from 1430 to 1730 kitchen is closed. The Rundweg around the castle has excellent views esp just at the gate. It felt a worthy place to spend a lot of time as was super peaceful. If they would dress all the staff in clothes from the time castle was built this would be perfect. This is one place that i would call super managed perfectly.nit is a must go place."
Altena Castle,Ahmed Zahu,5,The place is amazing you can do alot of things and they have a beautiful restaurant too. Pluse the nature arund it is great you can go wandering on the forest.
Sooneck Castle,Gabriel Galarza,4,The castle looks impressive from the outside. Unfortunately we didn’t have the opportunity to go inside the main building as it was locked. Not sure if it was temporarily. We were able to explore the walls and the gardens. Entrance was cheap (6 Euros) and they have an activity book for children were they can look for treasure chests and open them solving riddles or puzzles.
Sooneck Castle,Purvang Kalani,4,"Decent castle. Once you park your car, it's about 8 to 10 mins walk to the castle and costs 6 euro for adults. Outside the castle, there are some nice flower plants to take good pics. The view of Rhine River is beautiful from the this place. There is a treasure hunt for kids and at the end, kids get a badge which is cool. The treasure hunt was fun and they do pretty good job of hiding treasures. The castle only allows 2 floors of inside view....I wish they would allow the customers to go all the way up top. Overall good experience and one can easily spend few hours here. If you are in local area, and if time allows, go here. if not, you will not miss much."
Sooneck Castle,Poh Mike,5,"About 40 minutes of train ride from Wiesbaden Hbf main train station, a couple minutes of boat ferrying across the Rhein river to the other side and some foot steps uphill along the beautiful grapes plantation, you will reach the well maintained castle and enjoy the scenic view from top. Of cause a cup of coffee and waffle to fill your belly's soul, heaven :)"
Sooneck Castle,U Kauffman,5,Loved every minute here. Highlight of my trip. Local Riesling was amazing.
Sooneck Castle,Sharon Eshed,5,"An amazing view, a beautiful walk up the mountain, the place overall is well maintained."
Kriebstein Castle,Maria Zhuravlova,5,"Well-preserved medieval knight castle, romantic and breathtaking place. Amazing views, close to nature, not really crowded. Interesting interior, lots of fun for kids. Ticket for adults about 6 euros, kids under 6 go for free."
Kriebstein Castle,Faisal Qayyum,5,It is a pretty castle. Entry in the courtyard is free. A path under the parking goes to the bridge from where the castle view with small dam on the river is amazing. A nice place to spend half a day.
Kriebstein Castle,Robert Turner,5,Nicely preserved. Medieval church with much of the fresco work preserved. There was a fun room where children can build a castle from foam pieces. It didn't appear to have a restaurant. The small gift shop was adequate.
Kriebstein Castle,Alexandrina Nan,5,"It is an interesting place to visit for both adults and children. If you havectine, don't miss to play the Escape Room!!"
Kriebstein Castle,Michael Hubenko,5,Nice ancient castle. Would be great experience for those who wanted to explore something from 14th century.
Brühl Castle,Ingrid Lustig,5,"Beautiful rococo palace. The tour is very informative. It takes about an hour. You can park nearby. You should plan about 3 hours in total to visit the garden, walk thru the forest till you get to Falkenlust (a secondary manor for hunting part of the complex). Definitely worth the visit."
Brühl Castle,1 2,5,"Very beautiful Baroque and Rococo-style castles. It is recommended to buy a combination ticket, which is a 30-minute walk between the two buildings, and you can enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. The complete tour of the castle takes about two hours. You can take photos inside, but you must be accompanied by a guide."
Brühl Castle,Emese B.,5,"Beautiful building, very nice park. Super easy to reach from Cologne both by the regional train that stops right in front of the castle park, and by bike. There is a bike path all the way from downtown Cologne - riding through parks and rolling crop fields. Perfect for a Sunday ride!"
Brühl Castle,Fon Prom,5,"I got discount because I am a student. It saved my cost more than 50% If you like art and historical place. This place is suitable. and it has guide audio for English, Chinese and many languages to support."
Brühl Castle,Usman Latif,4,"The palace itself is beautiful and worth a visit if you have time. However, the management has some downsides. Firstly, there is no English guided tour available. Instead, visitors are given a device that provides audio, which is impressive. Nevertheless, it is frustrating that non-German-speaking visitors are required to join a German-speaking tour group. The guides speak German, making the experience unpleasant for those who do not understand the language and stand along like fools.  The employees must show empathy towards non-German speaking visitors."
Vischering Castle,sahitya,5,"Impressive castle, with a fascinating story described in both German and English. Many activities for children both inside and near the castle. A great place for a weekend getaway."
Vischering Castle,O GY,5,Very beautiful place. Great for walking and sightseeing. Highly recommended
Vischering Castle,Αγνή Βογιατζούλη,5,"Very nice place open with nice to history also in english to read. The ticket costs 7,5 euros. And outside there is a small backer. In the morning there is a buffet with 18 euros costs but i think it is until 11:00. We ate 3 cakes and three coffees and we paid 19 euros. Also in the water there are some damn huge fish!!!!!!"
Vischering Castle,Stephen de Man,5,"A true moated castle with a fascinating history. Don’t miss the bakery, bring 5€ for a loaf of fresh bread. Inside the castle is a well done display of the history over three levels. The basement is great for kids - and there is a projected map display that is a must to see. The second level has the history of the castle with some interesting stories one including a iron collar that was fixed to the owner. They do a great job telling the story. Make sure to check out the bed display as well. Everything is in German and English and very well done."
Vischering Castle,Sarah Mo,5,Beautiful castle with interesting exhibition and helpful staff.
Schleissheim palace complex,Su Pa,5,"Just stunning! I love to get lost in the park between the castles, in the forests and gardens, it never dissapoints. Always a different flower decoration. Beautiful at every season."
Schleissheim palace complex,Puja Sharma,5,"There is a main central palace and two more. One can buy tickets for all or just one. It’s a beautiful palace consisting of tapestries, paintings and artistic rooms. The palace is surrounded by beautiful garden for a walk and a large fountain and mini water streams."
Schleissheim palace complex,david antoun,5,"Combine ticket of 10€ is recommended to visit the 3 castles. the garden is free though. it is an impressive part of the 17th bavarian era and the art work, even if it's renewed is something adorable. you pass from the old castle through a garden to the new castle and then through bigger garden and fountains and a long canal to the 3rd castle. the entrances are all centered with the fountains which start at 12pm and then turned off for one hour and then on again at 2.00 PM.  Very recommended Visit."
Schleissheim palace complex,Red Lemonade,4,"Decided to wander in here as it was next to to the hotel where we were staying and I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland. If you ever have some spare time when you're in the area I would highly recommend. The palaces are beautiful and very well kept, such a quiet place if you just want to relax and have a little walk around. 10/10 recommend"
Schleissheim palace complex,Majdouline Najdini,4,"Definitely a nice place to spend a day off, with a lot of greenery and interesting things to see! I enjoyed a lot visiting the new palace and walking in the gardens. I didn’t find the exhibitions in the old palace that interesting and was more amazed by the ceiling paintings than by the porcelain collection displayed in the Lustheim palace. Some of the buildings are closed during Winter time, but the palaces will be open. It took me more than 3 hours to visit the three palaces."
Sigmaringen Castle,Brian Planchard,5,"More of a palace than a castle, this is still an impressively large and imposing building that makes for good photos (though you need to cross the river to get the classic picture of it). The tour was via audioguide. I parked in town and had a short walk there, but it was relatively easy to get to. Less impressive than Burg Hohenzollern, but still worth your time."
Sigmaringen Castle,Виктория Зайцева,5,A very chic castle.  We came here for the second time.  The chic interiors of the castle are simply amazing. Great collection of weapons. But most of all I liked that in the castle you can listen to the guide in several languages.  You choose your language on a small phone given to you at the box office and listen to it as you walk through the halls.  Very comfortably!  No one interferes with anyone and everything is clear.  I am delighted.  It is very comfortable.  Other castles and museums should follow the example of Singmaringen Castle.  Thank you.
Sigmaringen Castle,Alejandro Arellano,5,"Sigmaringen Castle is a stunning Gothic Revival castle that dominates the skyline of the town of Sigmaringen in Germany. It was the princely castle and seat of government for the Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen for centuries. The castle is beautifully preserved and offers visitors a glimpse into the lives of the Hohenzollern family.  The castle is divided into two parts: the Old Castle and the New Castle. The Old Castle was built in the 12th century and is the oldest part of the complex. It houses a number of historical artifacts, including a collection of armor and weapons, a library, and a chapel. The New Castle was built in the 17th century and is more lavishly decorated. It features a number of state rooms, a ballroom, and a theater.  One of the best things about Sigmaringen Castle is its location. It sits on a cliff overlooking the Danube River, offering stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The castle is also surrounded by a beautiful park, making it a perfect place for a leisurely stroll.  If you're looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience, I highly recommend visiting Sigmaringen Castle. It's a truly magical place that will transport you back in time."
Sigmaringen Castle,Alexander_Germany,5,It is one of the beautifullst castle in germany on the swabian jura. The museum is one of the best       private collection from all eras. If you around you should go and have a look.
Sigmaringen Castle,Vicky U,5,"This is a beautiful, large and impressive castle in the town on Sigmaringen. The price full-price was 14€ in August 2023 and discounts are available for children, students, seniors and handicapped. This price includes an audio guide which takes approximately 90 minutes. The explanations are rich and detailed, for some this might be too much but fine for me. I would definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area."
Schloss Drachenburg,Gabriel G,5,"Beautiful castle. It's the only castle I've been in that seems livable and has a homey vibe Suggestion: 1. During summer hot days they should open some windows, I've noticed lots of people complaining about the stuffy air 2. Improve the online ticket purchase form"
Schloss Drachenburg,Alexandra Plamadeala,5,Beautiful place with great views. You can come here for all day and spend here very beautiful day with your family and friends. A lot of points view. Perfect for photo session. Nice cafe with friendly personal. You can eat here something tasty or drink good coffee. Recomand with pleasure for visiting.
Schloss Drachenburg,Michael van der Heiden,5,Very nice and not too big. Friendly staff and a very well maintained castle. You can not enter the castle itself with a pram but it's not too big so walking around with your baby in your arms is fine.
Schloss Drachenburg,Shashi Prakash,4,Nice place to visit in summer. Even better if anyone likes to hike and visit. The design and architecture have been kept well to quite a great extent and the garden around the castle is also well maintained. One can travel till here by the mini train also if a hike is not a preference.
Schloss Drachenburg,Hariz Aziz,5,"Beautiful place, inside out. Worth the entrance fees. Just need to make sure you have enough stamina to walk uphill for 15 mins from the parking lot."
Schwetzingen Palace,Adrian B,4,"The museum can only be visited at fixed times in a guided group.  If you want guidance in another language, you have to be lucky to catch the number of people for such a group.  Sometimes you can wait more than an hour.  There are helpful materials in several languages ​​of international circulation.  You have to stay close to the group and keep the pace.  The visit lasts an hour.  Entrance to the gardens (almost 70ha) is also paid.  The museum is well maintained. The gardens are beautiful in the spring when everything is in bloom.  There is a beautiful cherry orchard.  The park is also beautiful in the summer, the flowers are maintained and the landscape is aristocratic and of French influence.  There is a map and many benches to rest in the shade if you are tired."
Schwetzingen Palace,Minh Nguyen,5,"Cool palace with well maintained gardens and assorted statues and structures from different cultures. There is a reduced price for students, which makes the visit a total bargain. Some of the exhibitions are closed by 18:00 so it's a good idea to plan out your visit. We also spotted at least two groups doing wedding pictures and even a wedding reception being set up. Great choice given the view."
Schwetzingen Palace,Thiago Schlieper Gouvea,5,"The garden is amazing, really huge with a lot of beautiful things to see! I recommend coming at least for half day, because is really big and a lot to walk! I like coming here every season, the views change and are always beautiful If you plan to come more than 5 times in the year, its worthy to have the year ticket. During the weekends there are more people, but this is not a problem as it is really big and there is enough space for everyone!"
Schwetzingen Palace,Betty Davis,5,"Its a beautiful Palace with different Highlights like the Apollotempel, Palace theatre, Garten Tempel, a huge amazing Garten, The End of the World among others. Take a tour you won't regret it 🙂 The Town of Schwetzingen (Baden Württemberg) is not so far from gorgeous town Heidelberg and Mannheim."
Schwetzingen Palace,Sude Türker,5,A very beautiful and peaceful garden. It was so big that we couldn’t see all of it (We missed a few places) It was definitely worth the 1 hour ride.
Parador de Alarcón,Maria-Jose Rapaille-Arias,4,A unique place to spend a day and a night. Rooms are very spacious and decorated in the style of the castle. It has an amazing location and the views are breathtaking. The restaurant has a top quality service and food.
Parador de Alarcón,Danielle A,5,Amazing! So so beautiful. Such Ana amazing experience. Highly encourage the Jr. Suite. You are in the top most room in the tower and have private access to the roof. Really a fairytale. Staff was so nice. Restaurant was amazing. So so good and beautiful ambiance. Beds are pretty hard.
Parador de Alarcón,Rick Mentessi,3,"A nice hotel. A quiet village, we booked for 2 nights and 1 might have been enough. Not a great deal to do here apart from hike and enjoy the nature. There are a few great eating establishments In the village, a few bars and a few places of interest. There is the most beautiful church in the village, but it's only open at certain times, so make sure to visit it when it's open. In the main square, there's a museum of a building with the inside walls and ceilings artistically painted, we visited it, but found it not too interested."
Parador de Alarcón,Sherri Landaluce,5,"We didn't stay at the Parador. We stopped for lunch right before the kitchen closed.  Yaiza R could have told us no, but instead, she said let me check with the kitchen, and we had lunch their.  Her service was great. The food was amazing.  Thank you for your excellent customer service, Yaiza."
Parador de Alarcón,Christopher Whitaker,5,I had an amazing time staying the evening and dining in this castle hotel. This was incredibly unique and my favorite experience in Spain.
Castle of Chinchilla,Miguel López,5,"A must-to. Especially with kids. Feel and breadth our Albacete medieval's life walking by Chinchilla's narrowed streets and alleys. Don't forget to go uphill to the castell and back to the village center a very pleasant and instructive talk in the tourist center where yo can see cannon balls, two French sabers and a reproduction of the original castle and know a bit more about its history. Very nice experience. Don't miss it!"
Castle of Chinchilla,Adriana Berube,5,"Great! Here's your corrected text:  The Castle of Chinchilla, also known as Castillo de Chinchilla in Spanish, is a castle situated in Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón, Spain. It was declared as a Bien de Interés Cultural in 1931. At the moment, visitors can only access the exterior of the castle. However, exploring the castle's exterior allows you to witness the remnants of Iberian and Roman architecture."
Castle of Chinchilla,Noel James Riggs,5,"There are spectacular views from this Castle and it's certainly well worth a walk around. It's the PERFECT place to stop for a picnic or for lunch if you're on the on the A3 motorway heading towards Valencia or Alicante and need a break (hint sunset is the best time to stop here). Note 1: the interior of the castle cannot be visited despite it's perfect location; 5 minutes from the A3 motorway (it's unbelievable that this perfectly-located historic monument remains closed and underdeveloped to this day). There is a trail that winds it's way around the castle and along the way you can see cave houses bored into the rock (some are inhabited by local residents). Note 2: if you're not picnicking and wish to have a drink or a meal you'll have to walk to the old centre of Chinchilla. There aren't many restaurants or cafes near the castle but there are some good places to eat in the old part.  History: the area has thousands of years of history from the Iberians, Romans, Visigoths, Moors and of course, the Christians. The ""Necrópolis de Pozo Moro"" was found here in this area. If you're in Madrid at some point, you can see this amazing-not-to-be-missed structure at the MAN (the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid) which dates back to 500 B.C. (or 2500 years ago). Don't miss it if you're in Madrid.  Interesting facts: 1. Skeletons have been found in the moat surrounding the castle. 2. There was a post-civil war prison built right in the middle of the castle which has since been demolished. The castle has served as a prison at various times throughout it's history. 3. They say that the ghost of one of the mayors sons of Chinchilla haunts it's streets at night. The legend goes that he was mistaken for a thief and shot by a guard one dark evening. You might spot his spirit wandering around the castle grounds.  Have fun exploring around!"
Castle of Chinchilla,Ken Freeburn,4,Well worth a day trip
Castle of Chinchilla,Dan Littauer,4,The castle and town are charming. Only the exterior walls have survived as the interior was once a rather infamous prison and was demolished in the 70s. Naturally the castle is closed to the public and even if it wasn't there would be nothing to see. However the view from it is still very impressive and the moat that is literally carved into the rock is spectacular.
Tower of Tribute,G Griff,4,Tower with bell. Interesting side rooms off the main staircase to the top. 16 inch stone cannon shot in one room
Tower of Tribute,Kamila Świerska,4,"The bell inside the tower is from the XIX century.  We even heard it ringing. You also have the best views from here. In general, it is a wonderful place, 3 euro entrance, 6 euro if you add entrance to the Colegiata. We bought the combined ticket for 6 euro - we visited both Acazaba and Colegiata. It took us 1 hour to see everything. There is an audio guide that you can download on your phone. Must see in Antequera. Alcazaba, Colegiata, and Arco de los Gigantes - all these places are next to each other."
Tower of Tribute,Mike Ivanenko,5,Good
Tower of Tribute,Raff Tatee,5,Amazing :)
Tower of Tribute,M SB,5,"The highest point from which to observe Antequera, impressive views and a complicated but viable ascent (I use a cane) if you are careful. That the bell catches you being there is impressive. You can visit the council room, the guardhouse and go up to the intermediate terrace. On one side of the stairs is the old clock from the 19th century."
Cerrajería El Yelmo S L,Guillermo Beverino,1,"2 years ago they installed a new door in the house, after a few months it began to give problems (the lock stuck) and they were contacted to come and fix it...2 months it took them to see the door, after taking several mornings off waiting for them to come. The day they come they do it without tools and argue that the problem with the door is that it needs to be lubricated. The door works fine for a couple of days and then it starts to stick again, like this for almost 1 year after which lubricating it is useless. To this day the door no longer works... unpresentable!"
Cerrajería El Yelmo S L,Leonela Germania Lozano,5,They came to make me a door and they left it wonderfully. Very happy with their work!
Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro,Na'Tasha,5,"Came here for dinner and the staff was lovely, if you can get a seat outside, do it, the view is gorgeous. If you are staying at the hotel just know it’s at a super high point of the city so the walk back and forth will probably suck."
Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro,Julie Doyle,5,"What a lovely hotel - lovely room and balcony with great views. Short walk to bus 35 if you want to go to city (the walk is quite long down). Our dinner tonight was delicious, breakfast is the best we’ve had since arriving in Spain 2wks ago (so much choice). Staff quite friendly."
Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro,R DaDa,5,4 stars for the location depends on what you want.  It had a great view and some nice parkland around it but a steep hill from the old town to get you there from the old town so not suitable for all if walking.
Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro,baelavay,5,"You get what you pay for. If you can afford this romantic hideaway in the mountains, you will not be disappointed. Everything and everyone was superb. The Hotel kitchen is fantastic. Plenty of parking space. And of course, the room has a balcony overlooking the city... I can imagine an author writing their next novel here. Very inspiring and relaxing environment."
Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro,V E,2,"Been there couple of years for a night and came again with friends for some drinks, but the service was awful. We had to ask so they clean the table (it was sticky from the guests before) and we wanted to order snacks. The waitress said they have olives, so we said yes - but never got any, then asked again and she said there no olives ?!? And no more bread (at 3pm)? Please just inform is. Had to ask 3 times for the check. So bring patience with you if you visit."
Igreja Matriz,Ирина Шаврина,5,"Church rebuilt in the 17th century, with some Romanesque remains in the chancel and side door. On the façade, the interrupted triangular pediment and the window in the shape of a flower with four petals stand out. Inside, highlight the decorated altars. Some of the existing paintings are attributed to Grão Vasco."
Igreja Matriz,Gerrie Muller,5,Beautiful place in the mountains. Really worth it.
Igreja Matriz,Manuel Mota,5,beautiful church
Calatrava la Vieja,Arthur Brasz,5,Very old and important archeaological site for our European history. Site is not always open to visit. Check entrance or call the number on the gate to enter.
Calatrava la Vieja,Mohammad Alruqaiy,5,"Calatrava, the name was taken from Arabic “Calaat Rabah”. Alcalá = The fortress. This makes it the fortress of Rabah. So much history behind those walls."
Calatrava la Vieja,Clara Bella,3,"We came to have a look outside the castle after having lunch in the town and go for a walk but it's fenced in and not clearly marked on Google or with signs where to go to park. They said tickets were 4€ each whether you take a guided tour or not. Considering COVID is still rife, we thought you should have the choice of paying for a guided tour or a lesser fee to just do your own thing. We'll go back on a quieter day maybe."
Calatrava la Vieja,Bogdan Marseu,5,A wonderful place filled with history. Natural and green place. Wonderful to spend time with family and kids.
Calatrava la Vieja,Lawrence Duffy,4,Really interesting castle which was the birthplace of the Calatrava order.  Sounds to be a similar set up to the Knights Templar.
Castillo de Zafra,Sören Dähnrich,4,"There are 2 ways up there, you shouldn’t drive a car with sport chassis ;)  The castle (castillo) isn’t big but the Place and Look are very unique so is the view from the hill to both sides, when you are coming from the east, definitely go over the hill and explore the west!  Sadly the Castle is closed, so -1 Star. :)"
Castillo de Zafra,Dinh Tuan,4,"The Castle of Zafra (Spanish: Castillo de Zafra) lies in the northeastern corner of the province of Guadalajara in Spain. It is situated in the Caldereros mountain range and the nearest, little village is Campillo de Dueñas, is still some 5 kilometers away.  Built back around the 12th and 13th centuries, the stunning castle has been passed around amongst the Spanish nobility for hundreds of years. The tall towers of the castle sit atop a massive rock located on what was once the border between Christian and Muslim territories. The flat surface atop the rock is crowned with a high defensive wall that makes accessing the castle inconvenient even for those who live lived there.  In 2016, scenes for the sixth season of the popular series Game of Thrones were filmed here. In the third episode, in a long scene of more than five minutes, the castle appears as “The Tower of Joy”.  Getting to the castle is something else. There are only dirt roads leading to the castle and those are in bad condition. So, especially during wet weather, a 4-wheel drive vehicle is advised."
Castillo de Zafra,Jessika Curto de Castro,5,Beautiful castle in the countryside. Difficult access. You can't visit it inside but it's great to spend an afternoon or picnic around it.
Castillo de Zafra,Mike Smith,5,"As a Game of Thrones fan, this castle was a must-visit during our recent road trip. It is accessible by most cars except those with particularly low suspension as the last couple of hundred metres would be quite testing. There is a parking zone with information board and the castle is a further hundred metres or so uphill. It is truly stunning and it's easy to see why it was never taken by force. Under private ownership, access had to be arranged with the owners who have been progressively restoring it. But it's still a stunning place to see from the outside and run up those same steps the young Ned Stark!"
Castillo de Zafra,Rob Dowling,5,"Extraordinary castle, featured in Fane of Thrones as the Tower of Joy. Spectacular panoramic views and it doesn't seem to be very visited by tourists."
Castle of Lorca,Christine Okelly,4,Wonderful views from the top of the castle of the area around Lorca. Very interesting guide. The castle is the site of a very up market hotel but the historical elements have been very well preserved and seem to coexist comfortably. There is a small cafe with a performance area and the original synagogue is really beautifully preserved and presented. The castle is located on a steep incline and it's not suitable to walk to unless you're an experienced walker. I went by private coach.
Castle of Lorca,Carmen Seghete,4,"We tried to vist but the parking was quite far away and we were supposed to walk up the hill to the castle. Instead we went to the parador nearby - delicious cuisine and large parkings! As we are not young anymore and the way was too long for us to walk and no close parking to the entrance,  we did not visit the ruins of the castle."
Castle of Lorca,Richard Attoe,4,Nice castle in high prominent position with great panoramic views over the town and surrounding countryside. Free to wander around or for a small fee you can go inside some of the buildings. Be aware though that you have to get your timings just right as they only open certain buildings at certain short times. Plenty of free parking.
Castle of Lorca,Pierson Stratford,5,Good castle. Absolutely huge. quite interesting with good info available. its a really nice place and you can spend several hours here. its 10 euros a person to visit the extra bits (like the synagogue). There's a cafe here.  I noticed that they found seats for Spanish visitors ahead of the English people who were ahead if the in the queue. so be prepared to wait to be seated if you're obviously English. Good for kids too
Castle of Lorca,LEIGH BROWN,4,"Don’t be tempted to continue on the main route past Lorca. The castle dominates the hillside and is well worth the visit. It has the most spectacular views and is steeped in thousands of years of history. It also shows evidence of the more recent history of the area, with the visible cracks caused by the 2011 earthquake. There is a good audio guide that you can download onto your phone. The cafe was very reasonably priced and with a reasonable menu. Would definitely recommend. The walk from the car park is quite steep and it’s not very push chair friendly."
Castillo de Chirel,Cindy Marie,5,"An incredible and spectacular place to visit! Totally worth the plan to come here for a quick hike, and recommended to bring your own food and drinks if you are planning to stay longer while enjoying the great view and magical feeling.  My husband and I are absolutely amazed by the WOW factor the place gave us the feeling. And it seemed that not many people kind of aware of this place, so truly well recommended that you won't get disappointed and great for family outdoor activity as well."
Castillo de Chirel,Bruce Pike,4,"Four stars in my system means a place that I would return to and recommend to others. My 5 stars are reserved for the best of the best and not given unless I am completely in awe.  That said, this gets my four stars for the following reasons.  1) The trail to the castle is relatively well maintained. It is not far from the parking lot but the climb makes this a bit of an exercise with the castle and it’s spectacular views as the reward.  2) As mentioned, the view is spectacular! High above the turquoise Júcar River, one wonders what the life of Íberos and subsequent medieval occupants must have been like.  3) The castle is somewhat well preserved. Enough so to provide a good idea of the original structure before time and an earthquake took its toll.  4) For a small castle, there is good signage documenting the history of the castle and area.  On our way to get to this destination, along  the National highway N-330, we were tempted by 5 other castles, making note of them for a future castle tour. We are glad we waited for this one."
Castillo de Chirel,Pietro DC,5,"Wonderful spot for a 30min easy walk and a wide 360° breathtaking view from ancient castle ruins from the top. N.B. It's possible to climb on the top of the tower, but it's dangerous. Be careful!"
Castillo de Chirel,Tomas Karkalas,5,"Not much left of the actual castle, but the scenery around is just breathtaking. Easy hime from car park."
Castillo de Chirel,Bart,5,"What a magnificent view! Lovely little (but though at times) hike up the hill (beware, little to no shade!)"
Castelo de Leiria,L K,5,"Quite castles, no crowds, affordable prices for adults, $2.75 each, and kids are free.  Free parking at stadium when there is no games and the funicular (free) is across the street, which will take you up to the castles. Need comfortable shoes to walk inside the castles many steps and stoned ground."
Castelo de Leiria,Keshav Bhat,5,A quick funicular ride up takes you to the ticket counter. 2€ for adults over 25 and 1€ for ages 10-24. A step climb takes you to the top for amazing views.
Castelo de Leiria,Veronica Rondinone,5,Very affordable castle to explore and not too busy! Worth a visit
Castelo de Leiria,Artur Victoria,5,"D. Dinis was the longest monarch in Leiria, along with his wife, Queen Santa Isabel, who is attributed to the legend of the rose miracle (1), which is only one of several stories that were born in Leiria thanks to these kings. Several centuries later, the castle, as well as the city, would still be damaged, with the French invasions, being almost abandoned. It was worth the effort of the Castle Friends League and the famous Swiss architect, Ernesto Korrodi, who performed recovery works and returned the connection between this magnificent monument and the population. In 2021, the works of requalification of much of the space were completed, which allowed not only to value their patrimonial richness and increase its tourist potential, but also make it more inclusive and open to all citizens, through the construction of Two mechanical access (north side and south side), which are free of use. Legend has it that the queen left Leiria castle on a winter morning to distribute bread to the most disadvantaged. Surprised by D. Dinis, who asked him where he was going and what he took in the lap, the queen would have answered: They are roses, sir!. Suspicious, D. Dinis asked: Roses in January?. D. Isabel then exposed the contents of her dress lap and there were roses in instead of the bread she had hidden."
Castelo de Leiria,Eugenia Bychenko,4,"The castle is not big, but it’s a nice site to visit. Better during some festivals to feel the medieval atmosphere."
Castillo de Javier,Gary Menard,5,"Beautiful museum, castle, and chapel. St. Francis Xavier is the patron saint of missionaries and one of the founders of the Society of Jesus."
Castillo de Javier,Behzad Naderi,5,"It's a historic place of Saint Xabier, the place he was born and raised. It's a good place to have a visit."
Castillo de Javier,Richard Fieldhouse,5,"Interesting castle in beautiful surroundings with a handy hotel at about 150 metres distance for drinks or whatever. We arrived about two minutes before their last admission for the day at 6:30pm (fairly early for Spain?) We received a good welcome despite this. There are quite a few steps for the elderly, but they're all pretty clear to see and the people kept smiling as we made our slow progress through the whole building.  There are tableaux of St. Fransico Javier's journeys and times. Best are perhaps the tower and the original chapel."
Castillo de Javier,Yvette Bessels,5,"Beautiful castle that grew from a single tower. Not very large. Interesting artworks, including scenes from the dance of death"
Castillo de Javier,Jude Deluxion,5,It is a must visit place. If you are a Catholic defiantly you would know St .Francis Xavier. This is the birth place of St. Francis Xavier. The palace where he was born preserved well and there are Jesuits priests to explain the history. There is a museum which explains the life of the Saint and his missions in India.I was lucky to visit this place. You have restaurants front of the castle.
Stairway To Heaven,Hazel Tierney,5,"Romantic traditional house in the old town of Olvera. Very comfortable house just meters away from the castle, shops and bars."
Stairway To Heaven,Rafael Foncubierta,5,"Magnificent house located almost at the top of Olvera, with many details and very functional, ideal for a getaway or vacation"
El Diezmo,Ma Jesús Tolosana Bazán,4,"Fabulous views. Personal attention from the owner of the house who teaches the most interesting things in the area. The house has access on level ground and a bathroom for those who cannot climb stairs. The medieval environment is worth it. Although it does not have an interior patio, it is not necessary either that the environment is calm and peaceful to walk or take the fresh air."
El Diezmo,Jessica Nieto Redondo,5,"The unbeatable house, with everything you need to feel at home cleaning 10 The situation of the house is perfect and beautiful, with a great history. Located inside a fortress The owners are very friendly and attentive to our stay."
El Diezmo,F. R. M.,3,It is the little that remains of what was a castle. The surprising thing is that there are houses inside the compound and people live there. So antennae look a little weird in a ruined castle.
El Diezmo,Juan Roman,5,"The beautiful place, the house is located inside the Cerco de Artajona, it is super spacious, the owners are the best I have come across, who receive you upon arrival and explain the history of the place, guide you on your visits and during your stay are aware of what you need, my children marveled at Alberto and Anacris. It is also in a central location, if like us we had the idea of ​​going both north, west and east of the region. I hope to return at another time and it is clear to me that Artajona and the Casa del Diezmo are my location in Navarra. Thank you for treating my family as you have."
El Diezmo,ARANTZA ANDRES,5,We stayed during the Constitution Bridge in El Diezmo 2. We loved the house and its winery and the great location as well. The owners were very attentive and friendly. One hundred percent recommended.
Castle of Ourem,René Van Wijk,5,We did the guided tour of the Castelo! Great explanation and tour. Recommended
Castle of Ourem,Carlos Sismeiro,5,"Unconventional design for a castle. Worth going for a guided tour as the more interesting parts are, understandably for conservation purposes, under lock and key. Also worth it for the explanations from the guide."
Castle of Ourem,Crystal D'Souza,5,Astoundingly beautiful views of the entire surrounds 360 degrees from the top of the castle. Everything is in Portuguese but there is an English pamphlet. Definitely worth a visit. If driving streets are extremely narrow and a little daunting but manageable for an experienced driver
Castle of Ourem,Alan O'Rourke,5,Village of Ourém - a small beautiful place to visit and wander around. Very quiet & peaceful but fantastic views and sense of calm about the place.
Castle of Ourem,Filipe Picoito Jorge,4,"Gorgeous castle in which you can take a break as there are a few coffee shops there, and sincerely the most beautiful and peaceful fountain I've seen in a castle. Great sight seeing, really good conservation status, and although I only heard the tourist guide a few minutes he seemed very enthusiastic and worth it. I just feel like it's lacking, as many other castles, more information of the story throughout the castle, just enough to make less interested visitors a bit more aware of where they are."
Castell de Tamarit,Kevin Moten,5,One of the most beautiful wedding venues in the world. The service and food was excellent too. No complaints
Castell de Tamarit,Andrey Tkachov,5,A beautiful castle near which there are many picturesque hiking trails
Castell de Tamarit,Selene Ocaña,5,"Amazing place, tiny beach but beautiful"
Castell de Tamarit,Diego Velasquez,5,One of our favourite venues to work in Spain as wedding photographers @velasstudio IG
Castell de Tamarit,Bruna Reis,4,"Very pretty, we could enter cause it is private, but the view from the outside is amazing. Great area to eat something and enjoy the beach."
Castle of Cullera,Tom James,4,Seems cool! Amazing view. Cafe was closed though and I was dying for water.
Castle of Cullera,David Hickman,5,This castle overlooking Cullera is very visitor oriented. Lots of active media panels which explain the history of the site and the town. Easy walking around the castle with plenty of viewing areas and opportunities to take in the vista. Some parking available. Well worth a visit.
Castle of Cullera,Kimcyllerz,3,"It's okay, not much to go around. We went 10:00 here. If you are thinking to buy ticket in advance I advice you not because the woman in the entrance is not there always, and you can have the same view without entering. Better also to pack your own food (I pack tuna sandwich, try it lol) and water to save (8 Euro if u ask for taxi just going there , 3 euros for entrance, 2 euros for souvenir coin)"
Castle of Cullera,Gil Legerman,3,"Other then the views, the castle was fairly disappointing.  Not much to see, very small and mostly closed off."
Castle of Cullera,Cindy Marie,5,"We went here on the 26th of December 2020; we’re fortunate to experience visiting this place with lovely weather.  Unfortunately, apart from the cathedral/sanctuary - the castle was not open to the public. But there is a long walk heading down from the right side to see other beautiful sceneries. So much learning to discover while enjoying the view, but do take note - no tourist guide available; perhaps you have a local friend(s) that can share you the story behind or else, self-research 🤓  Best to bring your food, drinks, and wear something comfortable outfits and shoes. Check the weather forecast before heading there. You’ll be amazed at a stunning view, especially when it’s a super bright and sunny day.  Recommended visiting this place to see another side of Valencia that's not too far from the city, especially if you're living within the Valencia city."
Castillo de Sádaba,Brook Whisler,5,This is a great castle to bring the kids.  They can run around and have a great time and not feel as if they are going to ruin some priceless artifact.  The woman who gives the tours is very knowledgeable about both the castle and the surrounding areas and is wonderful with little ones.  There is a lovely shaded olive grove for picnics or to run off energy.
Castillo de Sádaba,Sebastian Jozwiak,5,"Fantastic castle in great condition, but only open on Wednesday afternoon, Saturdays and Sundays. Check the opening times before you visit!"
Castillo de Sádaba,Marek Wargola,3,"Not sure actually what is the purpose of this structure. It’s clearly reconstructed, maybe nice venue for a concert but hardly appealing as an historical building, also it’s located in the quite ugly derelict part of town, so no I won’t be returning there"
Castillo de Sádaba,Martin Parker,4,"Good looking castle, with views of the surrounding countryside."
Castillo de Sádaba,Kevin Culleton,5,One of the best tour guides you can meet. She makes you feel like you are living the past of the building. Well worth the visit.
Zamora Castle,ej rideout,4,A little run down inside but beautiful location with garden in front. Zamora is a lovely town with long history and several really nice museums
Zamora Castle,Steeve Nicks,5,"It is free! The castle is not very big, but it has good points of view inside the castle ruins, and spectacular views from the top of outer walls.  There are places to sit on the top of the walls too. It is a relaxing place to go."
Zamora Castle,Rui Braga,3,Free entrance. The castle is not that interesting but there's a route to follow along the walls of the building and on top to see the beautiful views. It's better to go early in the morning when there's not much people visiting.
Zamora Castle,Sandy Capon,4,"Good to visit , clean just no clear which parts restored when as nothing in English"
Zamora Castle,duckula,5,Fantastic castle ruins to roam in the evening! Sculptures and great views all around. 45mins. Gratis 😀  👉 Enclosed hours
Museo del Vino,Pete Finklaire,5,"This wine museo is fantastic, very informative with a special app for English and French speaking visitors. Very detailed and  impressive, & highly educational."
Museo del Vino,Bo Jansson,2,"Good if you speak spanish, otherwise not that good"
Museo del Vino,Yannick Rault (LV),5,Love this place for wine everything
Museo del Vino,Michiel van Wijk,5,Nice...
Museo del Vino,MARTA,5,"A real joy. Very well set up, hyper interactive, with many samples of the trade, with sensory places... we were delighted to be able to visit it and it is something that is definitely worth it. Obviously, you also have to visit the castle, the guided tours are enjoyable and it is spectacular. The wax figures look real! The store is also very good although the employees spend a bit of everything…"
Parador de Oropesa,G C,5,"Absolutely gorgeous and historic Parador. Beautiful rooms, magnificent decor and superb service. Plenty of parking and excellent restaurant. Mostly highly recommended."
Parador de Oropesa,Jill Evans,5,"Amazing parador spot. Really superb and felt very lucky to stay in this place. Food was great,several brilliant.  Rooms as you'd expect great but it's not a brand new 5* hotel it's history! Shower great. Only thing I'd have liked is coffee making facilities in the room"
Parador de Oropesa,Raymond Koome,5,"What an awesome place! Wonderful rooms, super professional staff and great food in the restaurant."
Parador de Oropesa,Mel Jones,4,"In respect of the hotel: pleasant location, lovely building.  Beds rather uncomfortable and room fairly basic, but fine.  Paid approx Euro100 per night, which seems fair. Pool good. Parking very good. Staff ok, although we had a voucher for breakfast which caused confusion because the first member of front desk staff that we presented it to on arrival said he knew about it, and pointed to another voucher he'd given us.  I thought no more about it until breakfast when it was pointed out that we'd been given a voucher for a free drink (which we had obviously missed out on using) and they had no record of our breakfast voucher.  The manager resolved the matter promptly and without fuss, but it did come across as a little disorganised.  In respect of the restaurant - wow, amazing view if you can get a window table.  Food was reasonably pricey, but good quality and most enjoyable."
Parador de Oropesa,Dejai Carter,4,Castle like adventure without the musky order or smell. Very clean and nice!
Castelo de Sesimbra,Mairi Cheesman,4,"Great looking castle walls, mostly intact and you can walk around most of the walls. Not much information about it. Beautiful chapel you can go into. Amazing views from the walls."
Castelo de Sesimbra,MDH,5,"Great medieval castle with a little hike to get there (driving is also an option). The castle itself has beautiful views. If you hike, make sure you don’t miss the steps from the street downhill, one of the photos has the entrance in it. There are about 350 steps uphill."
Castelo de Sesimbra,Eric Popiel,5,Scenic castle overlooking Sesimbra and well worth the short drive. Plenty of history to explore and many places to take great photos. Spent about 45 minutes walking around and taking in the castle. Great short trip if you are in the area. And you can’t beat the price…it’s free!
Castelo de Sesimbra,Rick Crespo,5,"This castle is a 20 minute walk from Sheraton Four Points hotel. It’s a moderate difficult hike because it’s straight up. However there are steps and trail is very well marked as you can tell by the pictures. The castle is 16th, 17th and 18th century construction and has a chapel. There’s a cemetery with sites dating to 1800s. There is a cafe  and bathroom services. There’s no fee. It provide some great views of the bay and the castle and church are architecturally impressive."
Castelo de Sesimbra,Solomon Hafer,5,Amazing castle in great condition. The church inside is beautiful and covered in blue painted tiles.
Castle of Trancoso,Sue Crossley,5,"Beautiful castle typical of Portuguese towns, with knowledgeable staff giving information, well worth a visit, but really busy on Good Friday as it is also market day."
Castle of Trancoso,Sebastian Zieliński,5,"I love this old town!!! It's so magic, old but kept it good condition. Awesome! You have to take a walk on the city walls. Wow! Great place with so big old historical center!"
Castle of Trancoso,Mihail Jovmir (M.J.),5,A very beautiful and interesting place for visit.
Castle of Trancoso,Tim Burns,5,The whole village is enclosed by walls and gates. Very well preserved. A good tourist info center located in the village square just outside a gate. Be sure to see the tombs carved in stone located outside the village walls.
Castle of Trancoso,Rui Garcia,5,Very nice town to visit. The castle is still intact and the old town still lives inside castle walls.
Alcazaba of Badajoz,dale matthews,5,"loved it, especially my two year old. He loved every minute of the walk around the castle walls"
Alcazaba of Badajoz,Patrick Ohearn Ph.D.,4,We visited briefly at night for dinner. The square was beautiful lit up with holiday lights.
Alcazaba of Badajoz,Curtis Johnston,4,Decently preserved Moorish castle with various display placards describing its history and what looked to be a reconstructed Roman fort at the center repurposed as a library but the description said it was a church or temple.. Takes about 45 min. to visit. It was free to visit.
Alcazaba of Badajoz,Sam Mukhtar,5,Nice stroll  along the old fort highly recommended
Alcazaba of Badajoz,Bart Polot,4,"Nice historic castle, but not particularly spectacular in any way. Definitely worth a visit if you're nearby."
Castell de Capdepera,Brenton Chan,4,"Really interesting castle with plenty of historical information provided throughout the space.  Located right on the top of the hill in capdepera, you can see why it has had so many strategic uses over the years.  Cool to be able to walk freely through the place where many have walked before for thousands of years.  3 euro per person on the door, card only  Be careful if your scared of heights and hold onto your phones :)"
Castell de Capdepera,Maryam Sodagar,4,"Upon arrival, I was initially disheartened to discover that the opening hours were different from what I had found on Google Maps. However, it is important to note that discrepancies in operating hours can occur, and it is advisable to double-check the castle's official website or contact them directly for the most up-to-date information. Despite this setback, I managed to enjoy the castle's exterior, which was still a sight to behold.  The well-preserved exterior walls, imposing towers, and ancient battlements evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Exploring the castle grounds, I found myself meandering through the narrow pathways, marveling at the intricate stonework and imagining the historical events that unfolded within these very walls. The castle's strategic location provided a vantage point to monitor and protect the surrounding region, offering a glimpse into its past significance."
Castell de Capdepera,joedelajungla,4,"To start I found the woman selling tikeks was upset for no reason and annoying even try to be friendly but she still been on the same mood I notice she doesn't like my ethics features, for another hand,The castle was beautiful to walk around and discover the place, literally you can see the hole city from top, good places to visit and discover the ancient Mallorca history, I advice to bring tou own drink and snacks, no shops inside the castle, but some outside on the town,  toilets are in place also."
Castell de Capdepera,Milan Vavřínek,5,A very beautiful small town that will impress you with its peaceful atmosphere even in the middle of the tourist season! I definitely recommend a visit!
Castell de Capdepera,Pavlína Hacko,5,Very nice castell. Ticket for 3€. You can walk by yourself. You can see the whole city from there.
Castle of Monsanto,Aaron Spicker,5,"What a magnificent place! If you're in this region of Portugal, you must stop and see this incredible village. Pro tip: comfortable sturdy shoes. It is straight uphill for about 30- 40 minutes of walking to get to the castle. The bonus bring your water bottle and hydrate and not worry about bathrooms. There are many on route to the castle."
Castle of Monsanto,Artur Victoria,5,"After the reconquest of the Tagus in 1149, part of the effort to defend it fell to the Order of the Temple. To this end, they traveled up the Tagus and, arriving in what is now Beira Baixa, they turned northeast following the river Ponsul, where they built several castles to form a barrier to Muslim incursions. Monsanto, donated in 1165, was one of the first places fortified - over a previous Muslim castle - as part of this operation, although in 1172 it was returned to the Crown. This Romanesque phase, which is now vaguely recognizable in the citadel, was followed by a major Gothic reform campaign between the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the following century, completely enclosing the summit. It was spared work during the Restoration War, but was remodeled during the 19th century. Extensive restoration work in the 1940s and 50s brought the castle back to its current form, sometimes debatably."
Castle of Monsanto,João Rafael Nunes Louro,5,Beautiful views from the top. Unique location and history of this place is really interesting. Steep and tough climb up there but its totally worth it. A bit more trees for the shade would be amazing during sunny days.
Castle of Monsanto,Laurie Finch,5,Beautiful a d worth the climb.  Purchased GPS driven audio tour which made the visit so much better.
Castle of Monsanto,Philip Mather,5,"Very rural but very nice, good sunsets, parking for cars and motorhomes (1 or 2) most of the way up. Toilets at the post office just down from parking and a few shops and cafes etc. Not usual too bust even in peak season. Walk up through the town into the castle isn't to bad for the fit and able. You can walk around the walls but not for the faint of heart."
Atalaya Castle,Pablo Silva,4,I enjoyed a lot the castle and the tour guide comments. If you are in the area it’s a must! Look out a lot of steps if want to go to the top
Atalaya Castle,Kacper K-ski,5,"Tickets are available in the Villena Tourist Info, so firstly go there to not run twice upon these all stairs. But after all the exposition in the castle is great, and this amazing view from the top of tower - priceless."
Atalaya Castle,Andrei Chetroi,5,"Amazing castle. Architectural discovery with some typical construction traits of medieval fortification construction. Museum worth a visit, be aware of its opening hours"
Atalaya Castle,Brian Vernon,5,"What a superb castle to visit, €3 per adult to enter. 👍👍👌👌👌"
Atalaya Castle,Jedrzej Kocinski,5,Very nice castle. You may enter and visit its interior as well.
Castillo de Monfragüe,חזי אינט,5,"Most amazing place! Breathtaking view, beautiful waters! One of the most beautiful places I have ever been!!! Seems to be a nice hike to the top from the bottom. Must stop, would definitely return!!!"
Castillo de Monfragüe,Andy J Heywood 63,5,"A fantastic view point for seeing Vultures and other raptors, with brilliant panoramic views of the National Park."
Castillo de Monfragüe,Gillian Mullen,5,Caught the free minibus up to the top of the hill and walked from there to the castle. Amazing views!
Castillo de Monfragüe,Emily T,5,Very nice views from the top. You can drive right up to the staircase. It is well worth climbing up the staircase for the castle and the little tower next to it.
Castillo de Monfragüe,Keith Parker,4,Great views from the top.  Enjoyable walk up from the car park
Castillo de Clavijo,Andrei Chetroi,4,"Picturesque castle with a lot of historical importance to the region. Place is located in the top of the hill overlooking three valley, a very strategical place. However, the fortification needs more attention and investment as it looks a bit abandoned. The entrance and area around the castle need improvement, better pavement and indications to make it more attractive for visitors. Additionally, a small museum on premises might be helpful. The views around are just stunning."
Castillo de Clavijo,Paul Myers,5,Fabulous view from the top. Pretty rough path up and a bit of scrambling needed inside!
Castillo de Clavijo,Andrew Porteous,5,"Magnificent example of an impregnable castle. High on sheer rock, with one very defensible entrance. Sadly now only a ruin. View into Logrono is spectacular. La Rioja at its best."
Castillo de Clavijo,Jan Panek,4,It is great and majestic. Very nice view. But would not recommend to families with small kids.
Castillo de Clavijo,RGR Rigel,5,Beautiful old moorish castle in La Rioja
Fortaleza de la Mota,Brian Medley,5,"A good day visit, entrance price reasonable. Fairly accessible tho ramps for wheelchair users quite steep. Highly recommended."
Fortaleza de la Mota,Dominik Andjelini,5,"We were just passing by and decided to visit it. The view and fortress itself are great. People who work there and their recommendations were very helpful, and the short 20 minutes movie in church was great. We are glad that decided to visit it."
Fortaleza de la Mota,Stephan Geyer,5,Impressive fortress on top of a hill. Seems like a hidden gem as there were almost no tourists on a weekday in November. The audio guide is really good and makes you feel the atmosphere of the past. Make sure to have comfortable shoes as there are many rocks and stairs to climb. Also for kids a good place as there are always new things to discover around every corner.
Fortaleza de la Mota,Vasya Konovalov,5,"How to visit(guide):  ⏰Time: you need at least 3 hours, optimal 4 hours to see everything  ☀️When: autumn, winter, spring - any time of the day, best option: start at 11:00 to have a menu del dia after the visit in one of the restaurants in the city. It may be too hot to visit in summer, in such case morning visit or a few hours before sunset is a good option.  💶💳Price: relatively cheap 6 euros! Great value for this money. No need to purchase in advance, avoid third-party sellers, they just sell overpriced tickets(which they bought for 6 euros). Ticket to town museum included in the price.  🎧The audio guide is on the phone, you just need an internet connection on your phone. Take your headphones and make sure that your phone battery is fully charged. Network coverage is great in the castle. Audio guede in your phone free or charge and support 🇪🇸, 🇬🇧, 🇫🇷, 🇩🇪.  💧Water: take it with you.  🥪Food: no food options inside, there are no places for picnics  👕👟Cloth: you don't need anything specific, any kind of shoes are fine as comfortable pedestrian passes are everywhere.  📷What to see: beautiful and biggest castle in Andalusia, wonderful views, historical ruins of the middle age town inside, history of wine production, water storage and even cold warehouse (middle age  freezer), cathedral (museum), lavender field (not worse than in Provence)  🅿️Parking: free near the castle, but the parking spot is relatively small. If there are no places to park on the parking - you can easily find a place on nearby streets(free of charge). You will have to walk to the castle uphill in such cases. Way back will be fast and relaxed.  🚌Without a car: you need to get to the town. No transport is needed to get to the castle. The town itself is a nice place to stay for 1-2 days.  🚗By car: roads to the castle are nice, sometimes there are serpentines. If you are on a road trip: the best option is to stay in Almedinilla a few km away in the mountains."
Fortaleza de la Mota,Jacqueline Clark,5,This place is amazing. Our first time visiting a city fortress. Amazing how many people must have lived there originally. Well worth a visit
Queluz National Palace,Ilana Sievert,5,"It is so beautiful, luxurious and well preserved. Each room is interesting and unique, I was truly impressed by it’s beauty. The ticket is 10 euro and includes the palace plus gardens. It’s easy to arrive via train, but it’s a quick Uber ride from Lisbon, perfect for groups."
Queluz National Palace,Lize van Biljon,5,"A hidden treasure that must be visited! The interior is simply breathtaking!  The city is busy with restorations to restore this palace even more.  The gardens still need a bit of work and unfortunately not all fountains are working, I guess due to water scarcity which is understandable.  It is still amazing to visit!"
Queluz National Palace,SOLANA,5,"Very beautiful palace and gardens and best of all, there was barely anyone there. I went to almost all of Lisbon’s must see list but this one is definitely towards the top. Would recommend for a peaceful and beautiful day out."
Queluz National Palace,Val Klionsky,5,"The Queluz National Palace is a beautiful 18th-century palace located just outside Lisbon in the town of Queluz. Often referred to as the ""Portuguese Versailles,"" the palace is a stunning example of Rococo architecture and features ornate facades, beautiful gardens, and opulent interiors. Visitors can explore the palace's grand reception rooms, which are filled with exquisite artwork, antique furniture, and beautiful frescoes. The palace also features a beautiful ballroom and a stunning throne room, which were used for important royal events and ceremonies. The palace's gardens are also a must-see, featuring beautiful fountains, ornate statues, and peaceful walkways. You could make half a day trip from Lisbon. During visit Palace it was not busy and everything was accessible. 7-9 min walk from train station."
Queluz National Palace,Brad Warren,4,"Really interesting palace whose restoration was funded by the very friendly people of Portugal.  This is a nice peak into Portugal’s past when it was a world super power.   The palace is small by European standards, but that is nice because it is very walkable.  Excellent examples of the styles of the time (heavy French influence).  The grounds and gardens are gorgeous and well maintained.   You can enjoy a fairly thorough tour in about two hours.   Restaurants and bars are nearby."
Vélez-Blanco Castle,Malcolm The Millipeed,5,"Wow! Amazing setting. Great castle to visit. Entry FREE! Stunning views. Looks like the kind of castle you would expect to have seen in Gamd of Thrones, especially the prommonade balcony. Privileged to have seen the eagles soaring past whilst we were there!"
Vélez-Blanco Castle,P,5,Beautiful Castle in a beautiful bucolic setting. The village is also quite attractive too. Nearby just outside town there is some delightful Cave Art. You'll need to check in first to be able to see it with the guide.... The scenery and mountains here make for a truly wonderful panoramic setting. A visit to both Velez Blanco and nearby Velez Rubio is highly recommended...... Lovely place. Entry to the Castle is free. The marble interior of a large part of the Castle was sold in the early 1900's and was put back together in the Metropolitan museum in New York. Now that's a strange occurrence and one that should provide enough impetus for a visit to see this unusual and historic building....
Vélez-Blanco Castle,Sonia Martin,4,"I visited on a Tuesday, The castle was closed. Lovely area stunning views of the church and surrounding areas from the castle. I visited early June very quiet. Street parking is free and parking up by the castle. Definitely worth a look"
Vélez-Blanco Castle,lynn odonnell,5,"Lovely place, Great views, staff were very friendly, free entry."
Vélez-Blanco Castle,Caroline B,4,"Lovely castle and free to visit. In need of restoration, it’s a shame to see a wonderful old building be left this way. Nothing to tell you what anything is and the only information at the bottom was in Spanish. Needs to be a bit more English friendly. Worth a visit though"
Castle of Amieira do Tejo,Rui Garcia,5,Great Castle. Main tower is well preserved but we weren't allowed to reach the top unfortunately. Still you can walk around the walls easily
Castle of Amieira do Tejo,Edmundo Pais,5,"Lovely place, nice for a family visit."
Castle of Amieira do Tejo,Emma Thompson Nydal,5,"Great castle, well restored, worth a visit."
Castle of Amieira do Tejo,Maarten K,4,"Nice castle, not very big but worth a visit"
Castle of Amieira do Tejo,Andrea Kondor,5,"Nice castle, the entry is 2 euro and you pay it in the tourism information office right in front of the castle."
Montgrí Castle,Chris Bennett,5,Great little walk up to the castle. Good views from the top. Quite a rocky trail but not too difficult
Montgrí Castle,Dio De Leon,5,Nice hiking experience with the family including my 5 years old. He did just great. About the itinerary can be challenging at times but we managed. Recommend to take lots of water. Bring your hiking shoes for a better experience.
Montgrí Castle,Kristof Meirlaen (Kri-Soft),5,"The walk to the castle is doable for most people.  It is sometimes steep, but not too far so perfect as a small activity in the morning (when it is not too hot yet).  Park your car at the bottom in Toroella and start walking up, the trail is obvious and after about an hour you will be rewarded with some amazing views at the top."
Montgrí Castle,James Cox,4,"Worth the walk up path up is very rocky in places see photos, would love to do the path on a MTB. Not much to see when you get up to the actual castle. Views are amazing though. Walking up I'd strongly recommend a hiking boot."
Montgrí Castle,Kent Haizlett,5,A very nice hike. The views are spectacular. They closed the trail due to fear of fires they day after I went. I would recommend going Early in the morning around 7am.
Castelo dos Mouros,Alessandro Esposito,5,"Amazing Place with a stunning view as well. Not really far from more notorious Sintra Palace and definitely worth a visit. I suffer from vertigo and let me tell you, in some places it wasn't easy for me to keep going on those stairs, but the views were clearly worth it."
Castelo dos Mouros,Dan,5,"Amazing views over the area. Paved walkway to the castle, however some parts can be steep! Fine enough for pushchairs and buggys. Would recommend also, not suitable for above, but the walk around the walls and to the top of the castle for the best views. Expect to spend about 1hr-2hr here, but the price is about right for what is here. Do *not* drive here!"
Castelo dos Mouros,É E,5,"A very unique, interesting, wonderful, great experience. I've seen it many times, I can't get tired of it. This is a must see. You need warm clothes, it's always cold and windy. Hiking boots and good condition are important."
Castelo dos Mouros,Ian DSa,5,"Loved every minute of this visit to Castelo dos Mouros. Costs about 8 Euros to get into and was well worth it to walk around the castle grounds and enjoy the views of the city below. Be prepared to do a lot of stair climbing and wear comfortable shoes and always watch your step, some of the pathways are very narrow with no guardrails."
Castelo dos Mouros,Bruce Elliot,5,"Lots of great views.  Lots of climbing up for the views.  Nicely restored castle.  Beware of the vertical needed to really enjoy the place though.  There are toilets inside the gates with the small cafe.  Tickets CAN be purchased at the gates, if you take a Bolt to the guard house."
Castle of Montsoriu,Ahmet Aydemir,5,The around is quite spectacular also the view is so amazing. Entre ticket is not expensive. I recommend this place
Castle of Montsoriu,Michael Kosman,5,"Amazing with spectacular views and nice hike from the parking. It's real fortress, no wonder why 1200 men can't force into it after claiming that hill"
Castle of Montsoriu,Nancy Pierce Murano,5,"Beautiful hike to the top from the free parking lot. €6 adults, pay in the gift shop at the castle entrance. Fantastic efforts in repairing and restoring the beautiful castle!!! Amazing views, wonderful history, excellent self-guided tour. Will do it again when we have visitors!!"
Castle of Montsoriu,Marta,5,We loved visiting this place with our guide! It’s a not so well known Gothic gem. Our guide was extremely passionate and engaging. I learned a lot and enjoyed it thoroughly. Visits are in Spanish and Catalan only.
Castle of Montsoriu,Lluís Bertran,5,"Historical site of Middle Age in Catalonia. The venue is over a high hill with spectacular overview on the surrounding land,  including to seeing the Sea. It's a Castle with very interesting history about alliance and traitors,  peace and war.  Highly recommended when in Catalonia."
Castillo de Baños de la Encina,Kav,3,"I'm sure it would have been a great place to visit but unfortunately it's closed on Tuesdays, don't understand why tourist attractions in most cities and countries aren't open 7 days a week, it just doesn't make sense in this day and age????????????"
Castillo de Baños de la Encina,Sandy Hicks,4,"Lovely building, with information panels in Spanish and English.  We paid for the guided tour, but she wasn't interested in doing this and spent her time chatting to another colleague.  Disappointing aspect. Castle definitely worth a visit though. Nice views."
Castillo de Baños de la Encina,Leena Jaakkola,5,"Beautiful castle, interesting history, good guide, buy tickets from the tourist office."
Castillo de Baños de la Encina,Nikki Parker,5,"Booked and paid online just a day before for our visit on 7 May. There were only two other people visiting at the same time. Our guide (a young blonde haired girl from Baños de la Encina) was very enthusiastic. She spoke solidly for more than half an hour, then gave us time to look around by ourselves. The tour was in Spanish. I didn't ask if there was an English option and can understand that it would take twice as long to do it in two languages. It would be nice if there was a paper copy of some key points in English for foreigners whose Spanish isn't fluent. We loved the castle and would definitely recommend the tour. There is a large public car park just below the castle, near the tourist information office."
Castillo de Baños de la Encina,Alan C (AlanC-LAUK),5,Well preserved castle with great views of the surrounding country. Good tour for 3 euro but in Spanish as there were only 2 English speakers. Still worth it. Parking nearby. Hiking trails nearby.
Castelo de Soutomaior,david gomez,5,"Amazing place. Most of the castle it is open so you can visit almost all the rooms. For my the best part of the castle is the outside, you can go up to the walls, enter through the bridge, understand how the people defend the castle. Also, you can walk through the forest to see the vineyard and a water mill"
Castelo de Soutomaior,Ricardo Silva,5,"Beautiful place with a very good organization to explore the castle and understand the history. Not only the castle visit is recommended, the outside area must be appreciated with very agreeable gardens and astonishing trees."
Castelo de Soutomaior,Neil Tory,5,"An absolute gem.   A turbulent past, very well documented and beautifully presented (information in excellent English).  But as well as the sense of exploring a proper fortified castle,  you have lovely gardens on the hillside, maintained by a whole army of workers.  Exotic trees, a vineyard, great views and a cafe.   And all for €2.50 if you're over 65, which you only need to pay if you are going into the castle itself."
Castelo de Soutomaior,Keila Pallarés Pousada,5,"Absolutely beautiful place to go. I loved the atmosphere, the light, nature around the castle and the ruins. Strongly recommend it for those who love nature, walks and photography. #galicia #soutomaior #photography"
Castelo de Soutomaior,Paul Leahy,5,Beautiful cool and shady gardens. The castle is wonderful and it's story is well presented with static and film information. Thank you to the very enthusiastic and knowledgeable Miguel at the ticket office for all the information he gave us👍
San Fabiano,anthony wilkinson,5,We got married here! Without doubt the best venue. Made better by how friendly the entire family are. Our guests were blown away and couldn't stop talking about it. We'll be back. 10 out of 5 stars :)
San Fabiano,Alba Sommerschield,5,"It is hard to overstate how beautiful this location is - the dream castle and the romantic, calm getaway in the heart of Tuscany. The family is welcoming, kind and generous with recommendations and advice on how best to visit the area. The rooms are large, tastefully decorated and cleaning is prompt. The highlight must be the breakfast with home-baked cakes and fresh cheeses from the area, to be enjoyed on the sunshine terrace overlooking the immaculate gardens and pool on the notes of Ella Fitzgerald. Definitely recommend as the perfect base to visit this gorgeous region."
San Fabiano,Calvin Yau,5,"Magical place to stay, and fantastic to get some time off the bigger cities. We stayed for 3 days and the location was perfect for relax in the pool or day trips to nearby towns/sceneries/wineyards. Castle is driven by a couple, who was extremely kind and have always time to inform us about activities or a story about the castle. Rooms was beautiful and romantic, but be aware of there is no AC if that is important for you."
San Fabiano,Lee Davenport,5,What an amazing experience! Thank you for allowing our family to stay in the picturesque villa and surrounding property. Staff and owners are welcoming and respectful of our wishes. Highly recommend.
San Fabiano,Jeffrey Duda,5,Had an amazing time here. The family was incredibly warm and welcoming and did everything they could to make our stay great. We toured local wineries and enjoyed the beautiful countryside. The breakfast was very good and we even got to try the super fresh oil oil from their recent harvest.
Castello Malaspina,Flavio Moser,5,"Just amazing! At this place you'll get the full, real castle experience! You'll sleep in old rooms with authentic furniture, you'll have a bathroom the size of which will make you feel like a king, and you can explore the castle as much as you like, day and night! Most amazingly, you'll enjoy breakfast in the old eating halls, using tables you wouldn't even be allowed to touch in other places!  If you like castles, knights, or the medieval period in general, make sure to stop here and spend a night or two!"
Castello Malaspina,Dominik Schützeneder,5,"what can I say: simply wonderful and adventurous. we stayed there for 2 nights. you can explore the castle at any time, day or night. the staff were as courteous and helpful as I have rarely experienced. If you are looking for something really special and steeped in history, you have come to the right place! thank you for this experience and it was certainly not our last time"
Castello Malaspina,Karin Schwendinger,5,"A romantic, wonderful and impressive area. the castle to stay is an experience and absolutely worth it. The staff was extremely friendly and give you extremely great tips away from the tourist crowd. I can recommend it there! Thank you for the great stay in fosdinovo "
Castello Malaspina,Sandra Timmer,5,"Wonderful castle with intriguing stories.  Lovely rooms, beautiful views. The guide tried to tell us as mocht as he could in Inglish. We had a wonderful tour and enjoyed it very much."
Castello Malaspina,Anastasia Negru,5,"This is a fairy tale place - it's like living in a museum. The views, the room, the staff, the breakfast and everything in between was top notch. It wasn't just a stay - it was an entire experience in a medieval castle! Absolutely fantastic!"
Castello di Petroia,Misa Relic,5,Lovely castle to visit and stay. Perfect stuff! Reception 101 points Very good food and exceptional service. Will comeback :)
Castello di Petroia,Juliet and Theo Amore,4,"Beautiful castle bursting with history and panoramic views. It is very dramatic and romantic. The tower room is an experience, lucky we had it only for 1 night, as more than that may have turned an experience into a challenge.  The dinner is excellent, but the aperitivo is a bit pricey for a rural affair  - 8€ for a small plate of cheese and tomatoes and 10€ for a spritz!"
Castello di Petroia,Marlene G,4,"Great view, good food and big, comfortable rooms. There's some friendly cats roaming around on the area and in the reception so be aware if you're allergic. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Only the wifi didn't work so well and the walls are very thin, so I suggest to bring some earplugs unless you want to listen to your neighbors watching TV or the dogs in the room upstairs running and playing around all night."
Castello di Petroia,Daniel Hilling-Smith,4,"Pleasantly surprised. Great views. Interesting old castle. Lots of history and art all over the walls. Dinner was of a high standard. Rooms were quite large and comfortable. Lots of nice countryside nearby but you will need to drive to other restaurants. Friendly cats to pet. Whatever we asked for they would help, good service eg. We asked for softer pillows, bowl of fruit and to cook some food for our baby. All met with a smile."
Castello di Petroia,Jacmac,4,"Stay in the tower, lots of fun. Food is good, not great. Great views and several cats starving for attention outside. There are some walking trails, but not all that much to do here. Driving distances to nearby historical locations are not bad at all. Very quiet, and peaceful location."
Castello di Postignano,Lesley Maclean,5,This hotel is blissful. It's half an hour's drive from anywhere else but it overlooks wooded countryside and is the perfect example of how to renovate an ancient village. All of the rooms are separate houses and are very comfortable with sitting rooms and fireplaces. The staff is excellent. Service is first class. The food in the restaurant was unexpectedly good and we ended up eating there every night because there really is nowhere else within easy driving distance. And it is also great value considering the fact that they've got a captive audience. We simply didn't understand why we were the only guests there in early June. Although it would appear to be down to the poor weather they've had this year. There are lovely walks around the hotel.
Castello di Postignano,Mario Modica,5,Wow. Amidst the hills lays this remote oasis. A destroyed borgo that has been reinvigorated into a luxury retreat. Rooms are very large and well equipped.  We ate at the restaurant on both nights and the food was of the highest quality. Allesandro was an outstanding host who catered to all of our requests and offered his well considered opinion on the menu and wine.  Loved this stay.
Castello di Postignano,Samira Lakhal-littleton,5,"We spent few days here as a family. The Castello provides a unique experience, staying in a renovated hilltop village. Rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated with antique furniture. The rose garden and pool offer breathtaking views of the green hills of Umbria. The restaurant Casa Rosa offers sophisticated but authentic dining. Service is attentive and warm. Isabella at the Wellness Centre offers great treatments including a truly relaxing massage."
Castello di Postignano,Carina Matei,5,"If you want to make a jump in the past, is the perfect place to do it. Having a walk in this beautiful town will give you a wonderful experience. The streets are clean, there is a free parking lot, and the people are kind! If you can visit it, it's worth it!"
Castello di Postignano,Wendy Rancourt,5,"Very nice place, impressive!!! Large apartment with splendide view, free tour included with history. It’s a must."
Meleto Castle,crystal lai,5,"Castello Di Meleto is a ideal place for Tuscan vacation, we stayed here for 5 days and felt super enjoyable. Farmhouse was spacious with the bi-level apartments, surrounded by the countryside, we had light food and wine at patio, took a nap at living room, totally immersed the summer holiday. The only downside was no cleaning service during stay. Buffet breakfast was brilliant, classic and elegant dining area, Tuscan ingredients, olive oil and honey from the castle, all things were delightful. We also spent good time at gallery, Big Bench (overlooked the vineyards was amazing), swimming pool, wine tour and shop. If possible, I would like to come back every year."
Meleto Castle,Emily Bartley,2,"The location, property and surrounding hills of the castle are stunning. I wish I could give a higher overall score due to the beautiful surroundings, however there were many issues with the 3 bedroom apartment stay and we would not recommend the accommodations for overnight visits.  Check in: We requested early check-in, were told no but we could check-in at 1400. This in itself is understandable, but when we arrived at 1415 for check-in we were told the rooms would not be available until 1500. We ended up being let into the room around 1530.  Apartment: The 3 bedroom apartment is spacious with three bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. The beds feel as though they haven't been updated since the building of the castle. There was bad woodworm in the queen room so we had to move the bed across the room to avoid wood shavings falling on us in the night. The floors/walls provided no silence, people staying above us were so loud no one in our party could sleep until after 0300 when they would stop making noise. Overall would rate sleep quality 1/10.  Wifi: Very Poor  Breakfast: Overall pretty standard European breakfast, but they had some nice touches such as fresh juices and honeycomb. The dining space is cool being in the castle, hours are 0800-1000."
Meleto Castle,Joshua Fierro,5,"My wife and I stayed in the castle and absolutely loved our experience. Our room was clean, comfortable, spacious, quiet and so enjoyable. We also did the wine tour where I personally tasted my favorite wine of all time (Poggiarso). Staying in a castle is a really cool experience, im glad we did this."
Meleto Castle,Mallory Muncaster,1,"Dreadful Experience - Stay Away! My recent stay at Castello di Meleto in Gaiole in Chianti Tuscany was an absolute nightmare, and I strongly advise against choosing this establishment. The lack of service, the presence of black mold in the rooms, and the abysmal quality of the food made for an utterly disappointing experience.  From the moment I arrived, it was clear that customer service was not a priority at Castello di Meleto. The staff displayed a complete lack of interest and were unhelpful throughout my stay. Basic requests went unanswered, and the overall level of service was shockingly poor.  Adding to the dismal experience, the rooms were in deplorable condition, with black mold infesting the walls. This not only posed a health risk but also revealed a lack of maintenance and cleanliness standards. It is unacceptable to subject guests to such hazardous conditions.  To make matters worse, the food at Castello di Meleto was tasteless and inedible. The dishes lacked any semblance of quality or care, leaving me unsatisfied and regretful. I expected to savor authentic Tuscan cuisine, but instead, I was served subpar, poorly prepared meals.  Furthermore, we decided to cut our stay short and had our travel agent reach out to the management a week ago. Shockingly, we have yet to receive any response or acknowledgment of our concerns. This complete disregard for guest satisfaction and lack of communication are simply unacceptable.  In conclusion, my stay at Castello di Meleto was an extremely disappointing experience. The lack of service, the presence of black mold, the terrible food, and the management's failure to address our concerns demonstrate a severe lack of professionalism and hospitality. Spare yourself the frustration and potential health risks by seeking alternative accommodations in Gaiole in Chianti Tuscany. Castello di Meleto should be avoided at all costs.  (Photos of black mold and water damage in bathrooms attached)"
Meleto Castle,Maria Bulatova,5,Very beautiful and nice place. We had 2 bedrooms Villa with piece full and stunning view. We enjoyed every second of our stay on Villa and in the castle. Breakfast was delightful.

Castello Medioevale di Roccascalegna,Derek Craven,5,"Looks really dramatic from below and on any of the roads entering the town. Only 4euro to enter and a lot of restoration has taken place so everything is looking authentic. The steps up are from the middle ages and are worn, so anyone with walking difficulties could struggle."
Castello Medioevale di Roccascalegna,Joe,5,Beautiful and incredible view from Roccascalegna castle! In a very hot summer time you will pass some hours in a pleasant windy environment! 😅😁
Castello Medioevale di Roccascalegna,Johan Lammens,4,"Partly restored medieval castle perched on top of a steep cliff, but relatively easy to reach on foot from the town below. Worth a visit, guided tour included (but only in Italian?)."
Castello Medioevale di Roccascalegna,Nando Cozzi,5,Excellent rocky fort to visit. I suggest the guided tours (available at most hours).

Castle of Bardi,Megan Hairan,5,"spectacular castle, well laid out & informative. Lots to explore!"
Castle of Bardi,Volodymyr Kryvenko,5,Nice place for 1-2 hours
Castle of Bardi,Traveler,5,"Really cool and big castle. I truly recommend you to visit it, have a dinner in the  restaurant “Le Due Spade”, buy some meat near the castle in the small meat-shop in the street, which leads you to the castle. And as well i recommend you to meet the sunset. It’s amazing!"
Castle of Bardi,Pierre-Yves Martin (PYM),5,"Wonderful castle with a gorgeous view and multiple things to visit : local craftmanshi museum, hunting museum, princes house, dungeon… and everything is included in the entrance fee. The restauration of the castle is really good (you can visit almost everything) and well suited for little middle aged fans."
Rovine del castello,Sauro Morganti,5,"Castle, better to say Baronial Palace built 1047-1051"
Rovine del castello,Vix Chinaski,5,"Breathtaking panoramic place, in the truest sense of the word. Castle located on top of the rock, you need good lungs and trained calves"

Rovine del castello,Giovanni De Nicola,4,closed for restoration
Castle of Cly,Maurizio Vrenna,5,"Although not that easy to find, I strongly recommend this amazing castle! Its ruins are a fantastic example of medieval architecture, and a long history of legendary stories. The view on the valley is stunning! The entrance fee is also very affordable. The guide is great! Five stars!"
Castle of Cly,Matthieu Crétier,5,"The castle is extremely nice. Despite having been abandoned for several centuries and never truly renovated, it is possible to imagine how it was back in the Middle Age. Deserve a mention the effort of the municipality that opens it every summer. Not to forget the young students that with passion and expertise guide the tourists through the history of the castle and its development. Moreover the ticket is very cheap!  Perfect destination for romantic tourists with the gift of imagination!"
Castle of Cly,Kaminukas,5,"It’s closed now, but where’s ways to get in… I celebrated my birthday by having a picnic with my bf and dogs in the garden by the castle. It was a cloudy n rainy day but that made it even more enjoyable for me as I it was pretty spooky and melancholic… also, it’s so magical to explore a place like this all alone  🧚🏻‍♀️ Sadly I can’t attach any videos here, don’t have a lot of photos to add, but I promise it’s worth visiting in any kind of weather"
Castle of Cly,Shai Noy,5,"Make sure to check on the beautiful area behind the castle (a bit down the road, then a short climb on foot). The scenery is dramatic. Maybe you'll see a salamander."
Castle of Cly,Katharina Wa,5,"Beautiful ruins of a castle, with a great young Italian guide who did an amazing job at giving us a private 30min tour in French!"
Ovo Castle,Melissa Naja,5,"it was beautiful and unbelievable an oceanfront castle. It is free to go up inside and to the roof. Another name of the castle is Egg castle (sounds very cute) The castle is rectangular in plan, approximately 200 by 45 metres at its widest and the castle is popular for newlyweds to have their wedding photos taken. Inside the castle walls are several buildings that are often used for exhibitions and other special events.  if you have some extra time, there are some good views on the top."
Ovo Castle,Orlando Guerra,5,"Beautiful and historic place on the lungomare of Napoli, plenty of great restaurants and bars in the area too! Perfect for an evening walk and dinner!"
Ovo Castle,Robert Chomicz,4,"This is not a pretty castle, but it is a very impressive and intimidating one. When you think of the medieval ages, a fortress like this comes to mind. Located on a small islet, it jets out into the sea. It's free to enter and consequently pretty crowded, but definitely worth visiting."
Ovo Castle,Mircea-Bogdan Tănăsescu,4,Impressive monument feom the outside but not to visit. Lovely streets in the near port area
Ovo Castle,Emmanuel Momjian,5,A beautiful castle but it is was closed for renovation in late June 2023.
Melfi Castle,Marko Popovac,5,"Amazing. Much more to see than expected. Entrance fee is not expensive! Castle is beautifull. Museum even more. Although, castle is under maintenance construction works, if you are close to Melfi, absolutely recommend to visit. Don't skip the museum."
Melfi Castle,J Dunne,3,"It was ok, a little underwhelming. It has been extremely renovated due to an earthquake so the interior doesn't feel very castle like."
Melfi Castle,Mariam Habbi,4,"I went to melfi for a school trip, it was very nice! The city is very beautiful and very clean, then we went to the castle of Frederick II where there are many tombs, including a child with toys, a woman with kitchen utensils and jewels and a man with some weapons"
Melfi Castle,Tomáš Gallschneider,5,"Melfi is beautiful city with small streets, large park with place for children, few restaurants, kind people and with magnificent castle, where is to see museum with artifacts from antic, relics from Greece mythology, jewelry and much more"
Melfi Castle,Łukasz Kołodziejczyk,4,"Great place definately worth visiting. Museum contains 5/6th century relics of local excavations -  armor, weapons, ceramics, and many more. Open till 8 pm."
Duino Castle / Devinski Grad,Michael Hoher,5,"This long-storied castle is a must visit for travellers and tourists alike. 1000+ years come alive in this wonderfully maintained castle with beautiful gardens and the nearby old castle.  What I most loved about my multiple visits over the years are: + Incredible views over the upper Mediterranean Sea, the Karst, Trieste and Castle Miramar (another must visit close by); not to mention the fact that you see the Slovenian and Croatian coastline from there. + Impeccable gardens with numerous viewpoints over bays and sea and magical vistas of the castle’s many aspects and features. + The wonderfully furnished rooms with all the original pieces dating back centuries + Hundreds of artifacts including paintings, drawings, sculptures, historic books in the library, pictures as well as family trees depicting the owner’s family lineages going directly back to Charlemagne or Charles The Great from the 800s AD - simply astonishing + A glimpse into the dark times of WWII when underneath the castle a huge bunker was dug into the rock + and so much more  On how to get there with public transport: From Trieste you can take Trieste Transport bus 44 running between St Giovanni al Timavo and Piazza Oberdan in Trieste or the APT Goricia Bus G51 running between Udine - Trieste Airport - Trieste. For both bus options be forewarned to get your tickets prior to traveling either from a local Tabbacheria, ticket dispenser or other selling locations as tickets cannot be bought on the bus. In tiny Duino you can buy tickets across from the castle entrance in a small bar called Mickey Mouse - this detail may sound too much but believe me it will safe you lots of frustration if you travel by bus."
Duino Castle / Devinski Grad,Zoltan Bognar,5,It's very interesting and beautiful. Both outside and the interior. It's worth the entry fee. Very much recommended.
Duino Castle / Devinski Grad,Nataša,4,"Nice castle with amazing view. Lack of any type of a guide for entrance fee spoiled impression a bit, but would recommend it."
Duino Castle / Devinski Grad,Petr Sobíšek,4,"A medieval castle with a tower from the time of the Romans. Beautiful views of the surrounding cliffs. Possibility to descend into a World War II bunker. It still belongs to the noble family of Thurn - Taxis, self-guided tour."
Duino Castle / Devinski Grad,E R,4,"Pretty castle complete with amazing views. While the tour inside the castle is okay, the grounds are gorgeous. We were also very interested in the bunker, which isn't fancy, but has great historical value."
Soave Castle,Tarang S,5,A spectacular historic site that is close to a very nice winery and I stayed there for a night. The streets are calm and quaint and it feels like you are back a few centuries.
Soave Castle,Pertti Hätinen,4,Beautiful castle but hard to access. Tickets from gate at top of the hill.
Soave Castle,Paul Heller,5,"Really outstanding,  hidden gem of a castle, located about 20 minutes from Verona. The town of Soave is enclosed by old walls, whereas the castle is up on the hill. You can either drive or walk to the castle. There is free parking at the top. Castle closed midday and closes early in evening. It's 7eur to enter and highly worth it with amazing views of the town and vineyards, and alps in the distance. We spent about 45 minutes here. Can also climb the tower for superb views. Highly recommend!"
Soave Castle,Kyle McGuire,5,Beautiful town! Toured the castle and grounds- absolutely amazing!
Soave Castle,Aish Jesrani,5,Spectacular and great hiking places nearby!
Castel Lebenberg,Ionut Balan,4,"A very informative visit due to our fantastic guide. Even he did not speak English, We managed to understand each other with a mix of Italian and English. This castle is inhabited, so you can see a piece of history and not some empty walls. But the road here, using a car, is a little bit challenging."
Castel Lebenberg,Valerie Cousens,5,Beautiful place and an entertaining guide.
Castel Lebenberg,Anna Tasca,4,Great view from the road but unfortunately the castle is closed on Sundays.
Castel Lebenberg,full metal,5,Very nice tour
Castel Lebenberg,Toby Martin,5,Fascinating castle from 1200 and the guide did a great job of bringing it to life (in German and Italian). Well worth a visit.
Risorgimento Museum,Andy Woodier,4,Lovely place to spend a few hours including the museums. 12 euros for both. Only slight criticism is there's not enough information of background on the castle itself.
Risorgimento Museum,Guy Incognito,5,Beautiful! Well preserved! Full of history! 100% worth to explore! Make sure to grab the pass for  5 museums in Brescia which includes one of the museums in the castle
Risorgimento Museum,James B,5,"Really interesting museum on an area of history we don't know much about in the UK. Museum is modern, well laid out and the staff very friendly and happy to tell you more about the museum and its exhibits."
Risorgimento Museum,Francis Darlington,5,Great ancient sculptures and arts display inside. Absolutely worth visiting.
Risorgimento Museum,Paul Woodhead,5,A real sense of the history of the area
Castello di Milazzo,mar oroquieta,3,"Beautiful place, we went on the first Sunday in March so we didn't pay an entrance fee, the place is a very interesting historical center but in parts it looked very neglected, I think that importance should be given to the gardens that surround the church and to the cleanliness in general.  I can't speak for guided tours because I went on my own.  I loved seeing the archeology and understanding a little more about the history of Sicily.  The exhibit on the way the old locals fished for tuna was my favorite. Without a doubt, an activity that cannot be left out of your itinerary of milazzo activities."
Castello di Milazzo,Marc Schalken,5,"Magnificent. Restauration well done, respectful, clean and showing the grandeur of the castello. Influences from different ages and cultures, from Norman& German to spanish and arab. Great view from the walls and tower."
Castello di Milazzo,Petrica Nicu,5,Amazing place to visit. Amazing view of Milazzo and sea. Good place to relax and full of history.
Castello di Milazzo,Filip Fiebiger,5,"If you're mostly interested in expositions of weapon, armors, tools etc it is not for you, there is nothing there. But it is a huge area to wander around and feel the castle vibe that also offers incredible views from many places. We've been there for 2h and I think with the entrance fee of 5€ definitely worth it and recommended."
Castello di Milazzo,Nitzhiya Levi,5,"An impressive castle with a spectacular view from the roof, lots of climbs, you need to be in good shape to be able to climb it"
Castello della Pietra,Ste Paga,5,"Haste does not always bring advice, so the proverb goes, and often leads to not noticing the details, as when traveling on the Milan-Genoa route. We are so used to running towards the sea, that we leave behind without hesitation the Apennine valleys that we meet, which in reality hide very beautiful places, rich in history and life. Among these the Val Vobbia, lateral to the Val Scrivia at the height of Isola del Cantone. Halfway on the provincial road to Vobbia is this little medieval jewel, so particular that one is surprised when one discovers it. The access road is signposted, there are parking lots nearby, but not in the immediate vicinity. For visits it is necessary to inquire on the websites of the Park which manages the territory. To get to the castle you have to climb a mountain path, well maintained, but still mountain, therefore accessible only to people without any physical problems or not properly dressed (tennis shoes minimum). Along the way there are benches and rest areas. There are organized visits at specific times, with professional guides, paying an entrance ticket (about 5 euros). The castle has been beautifully restored, well worth a visit and the word of mouth"
Castello della Pietra,Laura Milia,5,"A nice surprise. Happened by chance, but interesting place. The guide very helpful and knowledgeable. The visit costs only 5 euros. To get to the castle you have to take a twenty minute walk uphill. It's doable even if you get some legs😅 if you're in the area I recommend seeing it."
Castello della Pietra,Fiore1 Sinopoli,5,There are two paths to get to the stone castle we did the .. path of the castellans ... four km long but almost all on a slight slope and in the middle of a very scenic wood. The two rock spikes with the castle in the middle are very spectacular ... the guide who explains the history of the castle is good. Highly recommended ... pity we could not get to the top of the highest spike. We will do it again.
Castello della Pietra,F DB,4,"Castle of 1000 AD which can be reached both from the woods and from the paved road, in both cases starting from Vobbia, or by making a circular tour. At 13.30h we did the tour with the guide inside the castle, for which 5 euros are paid on the spot in cash and the history of the place is told through the various rooms. The path to get there is not super simple but doable (there were people of all ages), inside the castle there are many metal stairs built for the tour."
Castello della Pietra,Fabiano Giuseppe Ghisolfi,5,"Castello della Pietra is truly unique. It deserves to be visited as well as the beautiful paths in the woods that surround it. The guided tour was very interesting and the guide very knowledgeable. A piece of advice, call before going there to get information on opening hours."
Sperlinga Castle,Gina Martin,4,Beautiful place with wonderful views. More of a group of caves than a Castle although there is a turret on site. Could be better signposted as you’re going round. There was no mention of toilets out the back gate so assumed it would be a nice walk but just lead to the loos. Definitely wear sensible shoes and the climb to the turret is uneven. Tickets must be purchased in the nearby bar.
Sperlinga Castle,Marco Sferlazzo,5,Amazing castle carved into the sandstone rock located in the center of Sicily. Don’t miss the guided tour by the Sperlinga Proloco
Sperlinga Castle,Joseph Meilak,5,Just lovely place. Worth a visit. Breathtaking view from top.
Sperlinga Castle,Cecilia Solari,5,"Interesting place, awesome view of the city from the top of the castle. 5 euros the entrance"
Sperlinga Castle,Josephine Farrugia,5,"The views from this castle are amazing. Don't expect a lavish castle, but the history is rich"
Castello di Punta Troia,Gaetano,5,It’s a good hour walking from Marettimo but really worth it! Beautiful panorama all along the trail and from the  Castel!
Castello di Punta Troia,Joanna,5,Incredible hike. Breathtaking views. Take a lot of water with you.
Castello di Punta Troia,David Lingard,4,It’s quite a walk up to the building but worth it for the view and to see the building itself. There is a €4 charge to look round the museum and if he’s not too busy the guide will take you round and explain it all to you.  Nice guy!
Castello di Punta Troia,Giulia Marinelli,5,"The hike to get here is harder than you might expect, but the views are amazing! Pro tip: get a boat taxi on the way here or on the way back, this way you can enjoy the hike on one way and the sea on the other."
Castello di Punta Troia,Bizu H (Acquario),5,Love the Wall and view. Watchout for jellyfish if your planning to swim under the castle.
Santa Severa Castle,Kevin Schmidt,5,"A great castle right on the shore.  We were surprised that this castle was more than a single building.  It had an outer wall, buildings inside the wall, and then finally the large castle.  We didn't stay here but I read it offers rooms to stay in for a very reasonable rate."
Santa Severa Castle,Anima Libera,5,Wonderful location! You can spend sometime in the castle and also have a nice sea coast walk. A big part of the castle is free to visit. A ticket for the museums is 8 euro for adults. The museums are recommended to visit. There is an interesting private museum of alchemy in the territory of the castle (entrance and excursion is for donation). There are also hand-made masters with beautiful creations. Bar and food zone is near the castle. Also a little restaurant is nearby on the beach
Santa Severa Castle,Roberta Damiani,5,"Stayed only one night but wished we could have stayed longer! Our room had a view of the sea and we could hear the waves breaking, it was wonderful!"
Santa Severa Castle,Robert Iordache,5,"The castel is very nice and impressive, more from outside. Inside everything is renovated and looks very new, but you can see old dresses and a lot of historical objects. The view from the castel's windows is amaizing."
Santa Severa Castle,Masha Sapojnik,4,Very nice and well preserved castel. We visited it at the end of September.  We were almost alone in the castle and the museum. Part of the information is in English. It is a nice stop on the way. There is a restaurant at the entrance and plenty of parking.
Castello Aragonese d'Ischia,Ian Martinez,5,"Magnificent views! This ancient town and castle are an incredible experience. The views from above are truly magnificent. There are a cafe and cafeteria on site for very good food and drink. Be prepared to get in some climbing steps. There is a lot of walking involved, but it's really a double advantage. You're getting great exercise while enjoying wonderful scenery."
Castello Aragonese d'Ischia,The López Brothers,5,"Just wow! The views from the castle are absolutely amazing. The keepers have put a lot of care and effort into maintaining local vegetation. The result is luxuriating gardens of olive trees, figs, cactus trees and others. The castle itself is well kept and quite quiet. Is well suited for an afternoon visit, before going to a swim in the sea and enjoying some seafood."
Castello Aragonese d'Ischia,Angela M.H,4,"Magnificent! I felt the whole scenery was impressive when the dusk was deepening. We went there to enjoy our evening snack outside of castle, meanwhile witnessed the poetic moment of late afternoon until sundown. It was quite pleasant and fresh breeze slightly blow in the air that was enjoyable. We didn't visit the castle, instead we chose to appreciate the great architecture and its surrounding together. So what a piece of work!"
Castello Aragonese d'Ischia,shodan hideo,5,"Beautiful castle offering breathtaking views of Ischia and surrounding bay. The climb is somewhat steep in places, and there is a lot of open spaces, so it may be tiresome on hot summer day - but definetely worth it. The ticket is 12€, but seems to be only for part of exposition - i guess you can climb to caffe without it? Didnt try it tho"
Castello Aragonese d'Ischia,Kevin Manrrique,5,Lots of stairs and walking. There is an elevator if you have an any issues with walking. Views are incredible and perfect for pictures. I advise going early or in the evening as it was way to hot in the afternoon. There is a booth that sells water for $1.  Bring a small towel cause you will sweat 😂
Te Palace,Judy Hung,5,"The entrance price is €15. (Not €7, Google map listed wrong). Every displayed room there’s English descriptions. Love the room with giants painting! Mantova’s free bus service takes you to the spot close to Te Palace, though it still requires about 10 minutes of walk."
Te Palace,Ruben van Praagh,4,Nice museum for a 45-120 minute visit. Almost everything on display is on the upper level of the walls or on the ceiling. The horse room and the giants room are sublime and a great addition to any visitor's cultural education.
Te Palace,Kimba Frances Kerner,5,"Even though the ducal palace is so promoted, this palace really was worth the visit to see the extraordinary ceilings and to see the room of the giants which is just shockingly incredible, not to mention the almost three hundred year old graffiti on the walls there, which is fun to read. Absolutely a must see, so do not miss it. Remember to buy the museum pass so you can save 5 euros if you go to the ducal palace and here. ❤️"
Te Palace,Filippo Biscarini,4,Splendid renaissance Palace with gorgeous frescos and paintings. Beautiful simple gardens. Some of the rooms / attractions would benefit from restoration and / or ideas for exhibits
Te Palace,Sarah Norris,5,"Absolutely not to be missed if you’re visiting Mantua!! The palazzo is full of beautifully decorated rooms with ornate artwork, as well as some information about the history of the palazzo itself."
Taufers Castle,Mr G,5,"Really cool medieval castle full of history, scenic views, and relics. We happened to show up right before the start of a tour. The tours are only offered in German and Italian. We grouped up with the Italian your being that we speak Spanish. They do give you an English handout which has some of the tour details. Most of the tour info is included in the handout. Regardless, our tour guide took the time to give us some tidbits in English during the tour. We were grateful to have Margarita as our guide. This place was super cool with so many things to see. Unfortunately for us, it was closing time right after our tour. Make sure you come a bit early to be able to see the rest of the exhibitions and visit the gift shop. And lastly, don't forget to leave a tip at the end of the tour. Enjoy y'all!"
Taufers Castle,Massimo Rosin,4,"Small castle is worth visiting only with the guided tour, which occurs more or less hourly, so there's usually a good chance to catch one. Price for visit+tour is fair. Currently, there are a few expositions which can be seen without a guide."
Taufers Castle,Louati Aymen,5,"Greetings, esteemed castle and chateau enthusiasts! Today, I have the great pleasure of delving into the remarkable history and captivating stories surrounding one of Europe's most splendid fortresses - Tures Castle. As a devoted castle expert, I am eager to take you on a journey through time, uncovering the secrets and grandeur of this architectural gem.  A Tale of Majesty Unfolds: Perched atop a majestic hill in the picturesque Ahrntal Valley of South Tyrol, Italy, Tures Castle stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the past. Its origins can be traced back to the 12th century, when it emerged as a modest fortification guarding a vital trading route through the Alps. Over the centuries, this fortress underwent multiple renovations and expansions, transforming into the awe-inspiring masterpiece we see today.  Architecture that Defies Time: The architectural prowess exhibited in Tures Castle is nothing short of astonishing. Constructed primarily from rough-hewn stone, it boasts an imposing outer curtain wall adorned with crenellations, watchtowers, and arrow slits that hint at its former defensive role. The keep, an emblem of power, majestically rises from within the walls, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.  As we traverse the labyrinthine halls, we encounter a fusion of architectural styles reflecting the diverse influences of the castle's many custodians. Romanesque arches transition gracefully into Gothic vaults, and Renaissance frescoes adorn the walls, evoking a sense of enchantment and timeless beauty.  Legends and Tales of the Inhabitants: Now, let me regale you with some of the enthralling tales of those who once walked these very halls, shaping the destiny of Tures Castle.  One such legend revolves around the enigmatic Lady Isabella, who is said to have been the fairest lady in the land. The story goes that her heart was torn between two brave knights, leading to a rivalry that culminated in a duel within the castle's courtyard at dawn. This tragic event etched a melancholic aura upon the fortress, and some claim that Lady Isabella's ghost still roams the castle, seeking solace from her eternal longing.  Furthermore, history tells us of the courageous Count Ulrich, who, during a tumultuous siege, led the defenders in a valiant stand against overwhelming odds. His unwavering determination to protect the castle and its inhabitants echoes through the annals of time, immortalizing him as a symbol of resilience and honor.  Tures Castle and the Tyrolean Rebellion: The castle also witnessed its fair share of historical events that significantly impacted the region. During the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809, the castle became a bastion of resistance against the Napoleonic forces. It sheltered local fighters who refused to succumb to the invading armies, and it is said that the castle's impenetrable defenses played a pivotal role in thwarting the enemy's advances.  Mysteries Unearthed: As we tread upon the time-worn cobblestones, there's an undeniable air of mystery that permeates every nook and cranny. Whispers of hidden tunnels, secret chambers, and long-lost treasure have intrigued adventurers and treasure hunters for generations.

Taufers Castle,José Luis,4,13 € adult ticket with guided tour. Tours are offered in Germán or Italian Worthy visit
Taufers Castle,Happy Cat,5,"A really nice medieval castle with lots of rooms to explore and an interesting guided tour. The lady that guided the tour was super nice, and despite the tour being in German, explained a lot to us in English and answered all our questions. It was an amazing experience.  PARKING: There is a good free parking available at the nearby town (Parkhaus Pavillon on Google Maps) with many parking places and 90-180 minutes of free parking. But the walk/hike from there takes 20-30 minutes, and part of it is pretty intense, especially if you are coming with a stroller or senior family members.  That is why it makes sense to drive first directly to the castle (Taufers Castle as a destination). There is a small (10-15 cars) parking right next to the castle, and you can park there for 90 minutes for free. Even if it’s full, you can still drive back to the Parkhaus Pavillon in 5-10 minutes."
Comune di Castell'Arquato,Arian Maghsoudnia,5,Very amazing historic place with a nice view of the river and farms from the above. You can see lots of amazing landscapes from the main tower. There are some local shops where you can buy homemade cheese and artifacts. 10 Kms away from Fiorenzuola train station; there are also buses to Piacenza.
Comune di Castell'Arquato,Marco Trabucchi,5,Wonderful castle
Comune di Castell'Arquato,Alexander Kushi-Willis,5,A beautiful place to visit with amazing views of the surrounding landscape.
Comune di Castell'Arquato,Назар Жовтовський,5,A nice place to take few pictures and hide from the sun during hot days
Comune di Castell'Arquato,Robert V,4,"Wonderful medieval town. The collegiata church and the small museum adjacent are the highlights, with interesting Romanesque carving. Castel'Arquato can get packed with day-trippers on Sundays, but mid-week it's delightfully empty."

Castello Federiciano di Roseto Capo Spulico,Lauren Sullivan,5,"Once in a lifetime experience! Incredible dinner, amazing staff, very helpful with my broken Italian. We ate Antipasti, first and second course, and enjoyed every bite! Please see the attached photo of my husband looking at his dinner the way he looks at our daughter, lol. And to top that off, since we were on our honeymoon, we were offered a private after-hours tour of the castle. It was gorgeous, and Jucy (spelling, Im sorry) was absolutely delightful. The whole team went above and beyond. AND DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN BOOK THE SUITE AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE? TO SLEEP IN!?"
Castello Federiciano di Roseto Capo Spulico,Turi Galbraith,5,"A stunning seaside spot, with wonderful views from the top!"
Castello Federiciano di Roseto Capo Spulico,R GONZALEZ,5,nice clear water  awsome views quite beach
Castello Federiciano di Roseto Capo Spulico,Mark Tundis,5,"What a cool place!!  Very interesting Castello and to make it even better a great restaurant!! If you ever have a chance, check it out!!"
Castello Federiciano di Roseto Capo Spulico,Laura Cammarisano,5,Lovely atmosphere and water. Always one of my favourite beach places in north Calabria.
Castle of Torrechiara,Mihaela Gabriela,5,"Beautiful castle to visit on weekends, uncrowded and peaceful.  There are also restaurants where you can have an aperitif, lunch or dinner in the surrounding area. Totally recommended."
Castle of Torrechiara,Todorovic Zoran,4,Made a detour to visit castle while traveling from Milan to Rome.  Only ground floor and first floor are available for visitors. Towers and second floor are not accessible.
Castle of Torrechiara,Andreas U. H.,5,"An amazing hidden gem in the Parma countryside. All the murals inside are of fantastic city landscapes from 1550-1600s. These murals might actually be one of the very first fantasy genre paintings in the world. An amazing example of the subgenre of mannerism painting, and worth a day trip to explore. Also exiting to see big displays of the two-headed Roman Imperial eagle. This castle houses a lot of symbolism and history of the era. Highly recommended!! I have actually taken away some pictures from this review just because you need to see them yourself to feel the authenticity of 500 year old fantasy paintings :)"
Castle of Torrechiara,Youri Rodrigue,5,We luckily came across this beautiful historic castle while coming back from a prosciutto factory. The setting is gorgeous set atop a hill overlooking the region with 360 views. The building is in beautiful condition with the original murals in great condition you really get a nice overall feeling for what living in a castle was like back in that period. The outer wall of the castle offers two restaurants which make it for a great stop just before or after lunch 😋
Castle of Torrechiara,Mike М,5,Amazing historic castle with beautiful frescos and painted ceilings and great views. 5€ entrance fee and there is some information in English. Absolutely worth the visit! There isn't much info in the internet about it so I'd suggest to google translate italian wiki article.
Castello di Grazzano Visconti,Daniela Molfea,5,"You you are there, please visit the small village. It's absolutely gorgeous. You'll never forget it!"
Castello di Grazzano Visconti,Federico T.,1,"5 euro for parking even if you stay 30 minutes! Not even in Switzerland! All of this just to park in gravel under the sun. The place is so small that you can walk through it in 20 minutes. If you park outside they're gonna give you a fine. Just go somewhere else, is not worth the visit since village is fake, builded 100 years ago in the mediaeval style. It's like a theme park."
Castello di Grazzano Visconti,Богдана Федорович,5,"Atmospheric medieval village! You can visit it by free, but if you want visit the castle it can be only on holidays and on Saturday -Sunday, if the garden-  twice a day, near 14.00. We used the bus from Piacenza every hour to visit this cool place, you can buy the ticket in Tabacheria, it costs 2.10 euro. Highly recommended!"
Castello di Grazzano Visconti,Aš Irma,5,"it's amazing , authentic place with really lovely restaurants and food . And my recommendation will be Restorante del Biscione."
Castello di Grazzano Visconti,Andreas U. H.,4,"Nice little village great for photography opportunities. However a little bit on the ""boring"" side when you have gone through it all. Most places only sell regular things, with some of them having a license to sell Harry Potter branded things."
Runkelstein Castle,Omkar Khandpekar,5,"Castle Runkelstein, a short bus ride away from Bozen, is quite unique in its compact setting and jovial atmosphere unlike most other castles. The 'secular' frescoes adorning its walls, unrelated to any religious or political subjects, instead display scenes from the courtly life of nobility in a surprisingly amusing and self-aware manner, while the 'summer house' is adorned with scenes from Arthurian and other Germanic legends. The whole exhibit takes around an hour to visit, and feels more like an amusing reflection upon the lives of the nobility rather than a museum, and is well worth a visit on a day trip to Bozen."
Runkelstein Castle,Dhanasekaran Selvarajan,5,Small but an impressive castle on top of the Alps mountains. The castle is reachable via busses from Bolzano/Bozen town. I liked the genuine attempt to preserve the remaining of the castle. Overall a nice experience.
Runkelstein Castle,Alexandru Ganea,3,"Just ok. We were looking for a castle to visit în Bolzano. They have many walls painted from  medieval times but the rooms are empty otherwise. There is one part where the tower is, which has nothing except renovated rooms with white walls. They might host some exhibitions in the future but nothing today. Entry price is ok,16 euro for family of 4, or 8 for adult. Only visit if you are in the area and need a time filler."
Runkelstein Castle,Luca de Waard,4,"Was nice to see, it is a bit small but the castle itself is beautiful"
Runkelstein Castle,Susan Demeter (Cosmic Witch),5,A small but lovely castle featuring historically significant artwork.
FAI - Castello di Avio,Olek Seleznov,5,Fantastic place - one of the best preserved castles I visited.
FAI - Castello di Avio,Brad H,5,Probably one of the best views from a castle I've seen in years. This is a very well cared for castle that is small but beautiful. Some of the best renovations I've seen structurally as well. Did a good job to preserve the history. The staff is extremely friendly and was very helpful.
FAI - Castello di Avio,Peter Reeves,5,"Wonderfully preserved 11th century castle that is well worth a visit. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and negotiating steep cobbled slopes, plenty of steps and varying terrain so unfortunately it's not very suitable for anyone without full use of their legs or wheelchair users. That said, the views are amazing and the staff are friendly and very helpful. There is a little gift shop as well as a small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, serving drinks and small snacks. The pasta bolognese was delicious 😊"
FAI - Castello di Avio,Ana A.,5,Wonderful experience to visit. Difficult to acess but worth the visit.
FAI - Castello di Avio,Simone Righi,4,"Beautiful castle overlooking Avio and the Vallagarina valley. Sections of it are quite well preserved, as you can see in the pictures below."
Arco Castle,Maria R.,5,"Wonderful castle ruins. I am glad I went early, as it can be a bit warm. Scheduled Bus and Go to get there (for 2 euros they take you to the parking lot). Be ready to do some uphill/downhill walking. The views are worth it. There is a bar (I didn’t indulge but it’s probably worth it even if it’s just to soak up the view."
Arco Castle,Erwin Jacobs,4,Great place very nice views. And relaxed small bar
Arco Castle,Sagee Schnaittacher,5,Spectacular day at Arco castle.  Don’t miss it.  Great workout going up.  Anyone can do it.  Saw lots of 4 year olds and well as 70+ year old do it.  Stunning views
Arco Castle,Jaime Mendez,5,Amazing view. Beautiful Place
Arco Castle,Prince Raassi,5,From lake Garda on our way to Dolomites we decided we need to stop and see Arco Castle. The short 20minutes walk was definitely worth it. Highly recommend to visit this spot take your time and enjoy the breathtaking views and even stop on the way down at the little bar and enjoy some drinks and cool off. If visiting in summer make sure to dress light as it gets really hot up there. And be aware of steep climb.
Museo della Bambola e del Giocattolo,Madeleine d'Armagnac,5,"The view from the castle is magnificent. The museum was a joy to discover. The dolls were absolutely stunning and very expressive . I could have stated for days there to give them names and invent a story for each. One is haunted, for sure ."
Museo della Bambola e del Giocattolo,Turan BV,5,Great Castle with a museum and good restaurant at the shores of Lago Magiorre.
Museo della Bambola e del Giocattolo,Angelica Bosch,5,An usual museum with a surprising collection of antique dolls and toys. Absolutely beautiful displays in an amazing setting. Strongly recommended
Museo della Bambola e del Giocattolo,Sam V,3,"This is a review for the Castle and Museum.  Having seen Borromeo Palace on the Isola Bella, this one is a bit disappointing. Quite plain inside, but worth visiting for the lake view. The tower was closed for refurb, so partial view of surrounding area. The Doll & Toy museum is interesting, big and well laid out. Labels on EVERY item (dolls/toys) should be a must. There are only generic info on walls, leaving you to wonder the history of each piece. Understaffed: no one in sight to ask for help. Shame..."
Museo della Bambola e del Giocattolo,Anonym Anonym,5,super
Chiesa dell'Oratorio,CA,4,beautiful church in SERPOTTI style. unfortunately left a little neglected for various reasons. this place is as beautiful as it is precious. places like this should be valued more. in sicily we have real rarities of architectural works that should be better protected
Chiesa dell'Oratorio,Ilaria Orlandini,4,"A place of potentially infinite beauty is left in a state of squalor and complete abandonment: the great statues of saints are falling apart, some are missing their heads, at times you can see the underlying wooden framework! All the decoration is in URGENT need of restoration! Above the entrance door there is a painted wooden choir stall, now dilapidated, but with still vivid colors, completely moth-eaten! The place is used, hear hear, a laboratory for children and a center for catechism ... Without words ..."
Chiesa dell'Oratorio,Nicola,3,From the outside it looks interesting.
Mussomeli Castle,Alina K,4,"One of the best historic castle  I have visited. The castle is castle by stair ,  it’s a bit of a walk , but well worth it. The views are amazing . Highly recommended. Please wear the right walking shoes."
Mussomeli Castle,Sha B,4,"Very nice castle but you can't visit all of it, I think they have to publicly more this place cause is deserve to be famous . Ticket is cost around 5 euro."
Mussomeli Castle,Stephanie Barbagallo,5,Beautiful castle ! It is amazing how structures like this were constructed where they are. We were able to walk through quickly in about 45 minutes but could have spent a little longer. Lots of stairs and not good if you are scared of heights. The view is the reward for the stair climb - definitely worth it if you are able :)
Mussomeli Castle,Sophie De Ketelaere,5,"Beautiful castle, pity not all of it is accessible"
Mussomeli Castle,Kim Gaarsdahl,4,"Cheap, beautiful and worth a visit for sure"
Bauska Castle Museum,Julia Maakar,5,"It requires time to explore. I suggest around 2-3 hours. There are several parts in the castle and if you have time, you will get a chance to dive in the history of this place. It was renovated and it looks fantastic. I took my time there and also explored the surroundings which are really beautiful. There is a person in every part of the castle who puts the hole on your entrance ticket; these holes allow you enter the section or the part of the place. It is easy to get there from the center of the city and it is quite close. At the entrance to the castle there is a cafe where you can grab some food or drink. You can pay extra and have a private guide or get an audio guide with a suitable language. Don't miss walking around the castle. It is located next to the river and the views are fantastic!"
Bauska Castle Museum,Donatas Oželis,5,"been there many years ago - when it was only remains of the old castle. Now it is completely rebuilt, also still keeping old heritage - well balanced exhibition,  - very interesting to explore, filling all the needs of different types of tourists :)"
Bauska Castle Museum,Virginia Batuleviciute,3,The castle itself is nice but the museum part doesn’t have much to offer. Interior is refreshed and looks well taken care of however exposition is very poor.
Bauska Castle Museum,Evaldas Alekna,5,A historical place where you can see the living conditions of the nobles and details of the daily life of the palace.
Bauska Castle Museum,Grip Production,5,"Haven't been here since childhood (around 15 years), and it was such nice surprise what they did here. Ticket price is very low for what offered inside, you can read, feel and touch history all around. Addition to that very nice location and view."
Castle of Jehay,Bart Lo,5,"Very pretty, but currently under construction. People at the reception are incredibly nice. The gardens themselves deserve a separate visit, so it is worth going despite the temporary closure."
Castle of Jehay,Mircea Tomescu,5,"Still under revamping but the gardens are nice, especially the nymph alley and the kitchen garden. Because of the richness of flowers there are a lot of bees hives. No worries, there are in a remote location."
Castle of Jehay,Mátyás Szaszkó,5,"Still under renovation, but it's getting there. They only charged me for the garden and were overall very nice and friendly. Worth a stop and a walk."
Castle of Jehay,Sophie,4,A very large big Provincial Domain. The castle is now in full renovation so you can't see a lot from the outside. You can't visit the inside at the moment. There is also a lovely church attached with it & a bigger side castle with a moat.  There is a lovely big inner courtyard with a tourist information center. There are many stylish gardens including a kitchen garden. To visit the gardens you must pay.
Castle of Jehay,Robert P,4,Château de Jehay was under repair when we visited. The place have beautiful sculptures placed along the vast acreage. Tranquil and relaxing even though the moat was being drained and smelled a bit. Definitely a place to visit if you didn’t have enough of 16th to 19th century architecture!
Erfgoedlogies Middachten,Bob Oosterbaan,5,Fantastic B&B. You feel like a lord of the castle when you stay here. Walking through the gardens at night is super cool
Castle Renswoude,subodh kumar rai,5,Calm and serene environment. Though not much to see but the Castle and Park around is a delight to watch. Definitely good scope of spending 1-2 hrs peacefully with the beauty around for few clicks.
Castle Renswoude,Andrius Pupkus,5,the park is very beautiful ❤️
Castle Renswoude,Jac-Louis van Rooyen,5,"Wonderful experience of nature and history that the Netherlands has to offer. Ideal place for a walk, a gathering with friends or just taking time-out by yourself."
Castle Renswoude,Michelle B,5,Beautiful
Castle Renswoude,Ronald Kaat,5,Nice spot to visite and start a walk
Castle Loppem,Eric Jacobson,4,Moor time and details would have made more a enjoyable trip.  I would like to begin by stating the fifth star is withheld due to the short time I had to cram this stop into.  I believe there was much I missed and more I could have learned.  The details abounding in this national treasure were everywhere.  I would go again in an moment.   There was so very much to see and learn.
Castle Loppem,L Marchant,5,"Loppem is both a beautiful structure as well as a museum & collection inside the building. Very well maintained, this location is well kept for visitors. The art collection inside was a real surprise. Clearly lots of focus on colonialism with objects from all over the world (probably stolen). The exhibits are very quirky & not extremely focused but interesting and worth the visit."
Castle Loppem,Teresa Powell,4,Very interesting place. Shame there’s no cafe as lacked
Castle Loppem,Daniel Sarbu,5,"Cannot recommend this enough as a short trip from Brugge. Not even a day trip, it was literally 15 minutes by bus.  The castle itself is beautiful and has a lot of small artefacts collected during the centuries. Well worth the 8 Euro entry for the ~half hour visit. But the true gem is the free to enter domain, which features a gorgeous lake and some stunning views of the castle."
Castle Loppem,R V,4,"the property is wonderful to walk around. it is close to a highway though, so depending where you are in the gardens you hear the cars. the labyrinth was great fun (and quite difficult to get out of!). i found the visit of the castle interesting (lots of facts about the family that used to live there, the war era and how albert I was there) but not per say my cup of tea. be aware that they do not take card, so have cash with you!"
Rumbeke Castle,Sanda Alexandru,5,Nice place to visit. Castle is a museum and it is surrounded by a park. If you are hungry it has a restaurant at one of the entrances
Rumbeke Castle,Lyon Chen,5,Nice castle garden to walk around. Easy packing. Nice toilet. A pity that the restaurant is closed.
Rumbeke Castle,Joren Moerman-Sourie,5,It's very calming and fascinating to see a castle in this part of Belgium. To see this historic building in Flanders is quite the occasion and it adds up to a refreshing walk in the park laying behind it. #GoogleReview #GoogleGuide
Rumbeke Castle,Andrew Volkov,5,Calm green beautiful small castle with nice restaurant. Short visit to have small walk around and nice lunch with and desert is appreciated
Rumbeke Castle,Irina Pascarita,5,"A big park, with terras where you can eat and drink. A large outdoor playground for childrens and lovely views. Recommend it!"
Haapsalu piiskopilinnuse varemed,Toivo Aarniste,4,A good concert venue
Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne,Ivan Dimkovski,2,Had high expectations of this castle after visiting some nearby places but this one disappoints. Very hunter oriented with few furnishings.... not a fan. But nice from the outside
Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne,Cezar Neculae,5,"A true gem of Belgian historical heritage.  The visit takes about 1h 30 min. There is a picnic place within the castle perimeter,  but no restaurant.  There is a private one 100m from the entrance.  The parking lot is quite big, with extra parking places on one side of the stone fence."
Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne,Tom Leclercq,5,It was an amazing venue ! Ideal for any kind of celebration 🎉
Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne,Filip De Beule,4,We visited the chateau during the Halloween period and were pleasantly surprised by the decorations and visit. Nice little shops selling their goods at reasonable prices.
Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne,Adrien P,4,"Nice castle from the outside, easily accessible, but visiting the inside is not worth it."
ADVOCATENKANTOOR COMITIUS,Tom Bax,5,They always go for mediation and follow things closely. The client is very clearly informed in advance about the possibilities. Top firm. Always nice to do business with them.
ADVOCATENKANTOOR COMITIUS,Sabrina Vandermaelen,5,"Very good help, sent in the right direction, thank you for your hard work"
ADVOCATENKANTOOR COMITIUS,michay94,1,"File apparently still not settled, not even followed up"
ADVOCATENKANTOOR COMITIUS,liesbeth nuyts,5,"Very satisfied, very friendly, perfect handling of file!"
ADVOCATENKANTOOR COMITIUS,Stijn Wuyts,5,Very good and correct advice and ditto expertise.
Het Loo Apeldoorn,Adelina Todorova,4,"Very beautiful, a little bit too renovated. I am sure the garden will be great in summer, however they are currently still working on it. My favourite #2 castle :) (Kasteel de Haar is #1) 🏰"
Het Loo Apeldoorn,J. PEROZ,5,"Number One Museum of Apeldoorn. Very instructive, and the Garden of the Paleis het Loo is truly beautiful."
Het Loo Apeldoorn,Robin de orgelman,4,"Beautiful beyond expectations, wonderful to see everything in full glory. Photos say enough. Whoever made the floor covering deserves a big compliment. The contours of the wood often continue exactly in the carpet. Really nice detail that people hardly notice.  The 'only pins' at the kiosk in the back of the garden and 4 euros for a chocolate milk take away my 5th star. And have to pay 2 euros for a sound device for a tour. I think that should be at the entrance at 19.50. Parking is also absurdly high."
Het Loo Apeldoorn,Alfred Post,5,"The palace has reopened after a long renovation. It cost a bit, but then you also have something! There are two routes in the palace that you can follow, which will take you past the most beautiful places. This includes an audio tour, but you can also use your own Paleis Het Loo app. Free Wi-Fi is available to guests in the palace. A beautiful space has been created under the forecourt, which is now the starting point for an exhibition about the Oranjes. We recommend the palace tower, with a beautiful view over the gardens of the palace. The gardens of the palace are beautiful and well maintained."
Het Loo Apeldoorn,Monica Van Veldhuizen,5,Beautifully landscaped gardens Very nice new cellars with exhibitions. Palace clear. Gain for the Netherlands!!
Groot-Bijgaarden Castle,Mohammad,5,"It is a beautiful place to see. You will feel very good when you see the old castle and the beautiful flowers. There were two points for me to think about: one is that I wish there were signs or sheets next to the flowers to introduce their breed to the visitors. The second point is that toilets only accept cash and if someone only has a bank card, they cannot use them. If you want to park in the parking lot in front of the entrance, the cost is 5 euros."
Groot-Bijgaarden Castle,Oldřich Malec,3,"0.5 EUR for the toilet, while the entrance ticket costs 16€??? It's like they want the people to piss on the flowers. I would understand paid toilets if the garden entry was free. Otherwise, the garden is quite beautiful, but there could also be labels with names of the flowers in each flowerbed."
Groot-Bijgaarden Castle,Radovan Zaric,5,"The castle is 15 minutes from the center of Brussels by car.  Surrounded by water and a beautiful bridge, this castle looks interesting.  What is a real highlight is the huge number of flowers that surround it.  a nicely arranged environment with paths for walking, greenhouses for flowers, rows of trees, and a restaurant make this place excellent for a trip.  The ticket for adults is 16 euros, and for children 12 years old it is 5 euros."
Groot-Bijgaarden Castle,Paula “LiveYourWay”,5,"This is a gorgeous place just 30 min from Brussels. You can take a train ticket to go and return for 5 EUR. It's a huge park area with a castle and lots of different flower arrangements. It's open in April and May when the flowers are at their best. Pick a sunny day to go, you will like it more."
Groot-Bijgaarden Castle,Noha El Bakkush,4,"I had the pleasure of visiting twice - once last April during the floralia exhibition and once  last December during the Lightopia exhibition. Both were great, but floralia was breathtaking, I was captivated by the beautiful floral displays that adorned the park, which took approximately 1.30 hours to fully tour. For a quick snack, there is a small kiosk that serves food and snacks and a small greenhouse with comfortable seating. There's also a small playground on-site, while photography enthusiasts and instagram lovers will appreciate the many picturesque spots perfect for capturing memories and photos that make for awesome posts."
Castle of Freÿr,Zoltán Csanda,5,"A nice place with rooms well furnished with furniture from the past.  The garden has ancient orange trees.  The AT booklet contains a lot of interesting information, I definitely recommend taking one with you."
Castle of Freÿr,Robert Urbex,5,"We enjoyed walking trough the wel maintained castle full of paintings, only the amount of information papers was a bit too much. The garden was bigger as thought. there are 300 year old orange trees all the way in the back of the garden wich is amazing to see."
Castle of Freÿr,Rens Hulsebosch,5,Rich historical building with well furnished rooms. A grand piano that can be played by those who want. Nice garden
Castle of Freÿr,Mateeva Natali,5,The castle is very well preserved and the garden is absolutely beautiful. Situated next to the river surrounded by the hills make the castle 🏰 feel like a fairytale.
Castle of Freÿr,Andres Ricardo Pedraza Alvarez,5,"Great place, pretty well maintained, and conditions. Great history"
Kasteel van Ooidonk,Zuhaib Ahmed Shaikh,4,"A very beautiful castle on the outskirts of Deinze, kept as original as possible. It is still the home of the Count and his family and can only be visited with a guide, due to the privacy of the residents. The tour is very informative and is only available in Dutch or English.  The castle also has a very beautiful garden which can be visited without a guide.  It is necessary to book your visit in advance for the guided tour (which cost us 12 euros per adult). Visiting the garden does not require booking and costs 3 euros.  The only drawback is that more than half of the castle is closed to tourists, but this is understandable."
Kasteel van Ooidonk,krisann johnson,5,"This was definitely worth the bike ride out to. The times are different on the door than advertised here, opened at 1pm. We only toured the gardens but they are very impressive gardens around an awesome castle."
Kasteel van Ooidonk,Robin Bentley,5,"My mother and I stayed here a year ago and it was AMAZING. Exactly as pictured! The grounds were amazing, the grounds keeper was so friendly and wonderful. We really felt welcome here. My mother still talks about our stay here and was one of the highlights of her entire trip to Europe. 5 stars honestly are not enough! 10/10!"
Kasteel van Ooidonk,Patrick Vander Maelen,4,"Today only visit of the gardens. Very peaceful,  beautiful views on the castle."
Kasteel van Ooidonk,Vinit kulkarni,3,There is also during easter weekend a flee market with entry of 8 eur. So we had to pay 20 eur ( including tour guide of 12)
Olavinlinna,Viliina Lilja,5,"Olavinlinna Castle is a strikingly well-preserved medieval castle in the heart of Savonlinna. The castle is open for visitors for a reasonable price, and the guided tours are well worth the price. The castle is also for rent for private events.  Every July Olavinlinna hosts the Savonlinna Opera Festival with very good quality operas featuring international artists."
Olavinlinna,daniel porter,5,Great experience to visit and see the historic castle. Quick tours available to provide ample information and the ability to roam the island without a guide and explore.
Olavinlinna,J W,1,"""Publicly accessible"" places for the same entrance price. You can mainly access a restaurant, congress hall and many, many toilets. Castle squares were occupied with a stage and seats for opera and were not accessible. Not worth the entrance price without guided tour. The castle was crowded with tours, but we couldn't join them (one private, another in German)."
Olavinlinna,I am Poiseul,5,"Great visit. Make sure to join a guided tour if you want to access the upper parts of the castle, the tower is not accessible otherwise by yourselves."
Olavinlinna,Dabrel Prits,4,"Nice castle, but as I understand you can walk on the walls and go to the tower only with a guided tour. That's unfortunate as you can't enjoy the views on your own pace and the tower visit really isn't very interesting..  All in all, if you're in the eastern Finland, it's worth a visit."
La terrasse du Château,Tabitha Duinkerken,5,"Very nice coffee, delicious waffles, friendly service. And best of all: an amazing playground for our children. Recommended!"
La terrasse du Château,Codrin Alexandru Burla,2,Very slow service. After waiting for 10 mins for some service the waffle was completely burned and had to be re-done.
La terrasse du Château,Audrey Renson,2,"We drove 45 minutes to visit the castle and enjoy a drink on the terrace and what a bad surprise to see that despite it being indicated on the internet that it is open, the terrace is closed! There is no indication of any exceptional closure...very unfortunate!"
La terrasse du Château,Ann Van Roy,4,Friendly terrace with a wonderful view of the castle. Self-service.
La terrasse du Château,Henk Spinnoy,5,Very friendly service
Brederode Castle,Aram Mostowfi,5,"A wonderful place to visit with family specially in a sunny day. Cozy and picturesque place. Notes: If you have museum card, it does not work here. This is an old castle which majority of it has been ruined. You should watch your steps on the stairs. Although only a part of the castle has remained, but still, it worths, giving a visit. A parking next to the site is available, if you go by car. And the route to this place is also delightful and charming."
Brederode Castle,Gia Metcalf,5,What a wonderful castle ruins that you can actually roam inside and out.  It was a gem of a find while taking the back roads of the Netherlands.
Brederode Castle,Denis Vasilev,5,Very authentic - not like other “disney land style” renovated castles. Recommended!
Brederode Castle,Francesca,5,"From the woman at the entrance to the stuff around the castle, everyone was kind and helpful. English is not an issue at all! Castle is a must see, and a must hear! as the vibe around the castle is just amazing Doesn't take much to walk around it, is a quick half hour I'd say. Plus: they have some awesome kids' costumes and swords and helmets AND WOODEN STICK HORSES to just get right at the entrance for kids to enjoy the visit even more than adults!"
Brederode Castle,Maketz,5,"Amazing place, I recommend to visit it"
Castle Doorwerth,James Wilson,4,"Located approx 20 min by car west of Arnhem and on the bank of the river Rhine, Doorwerth Castle is worth a visit. Ample free car parking only about 5 minutes walk from the castles entrance. The castles rich history covers more than 700 years. Once inside the castle, the route is well marked and easy to follow. The  rooms are well laid out, covering a wealth of information, covering military, social history, and nature, and make sure you visit the art display. Not suitable for wheelchair and people with walking disabilities as you have to navigate the route up and down many narrow and uneven stone stairs. The small cafe serves some very tasty cakes. If you intend to have a meal, make sure you acquire a menu while queuing as you will find no list of food at the counter. If you have time, make sure you take the short detour to the river Rhine."
Castle Doorwerth,Fabbs civile,5,Such a great place ! The castle and surrounding is just so much fun and so beautiful!! Deffo worth few more visits!!!
Castle Doorwerth,Dyane Hill,5,"Beautiful castle, self guided tours,  pictures are allowed, they have some cool period clothing to try on."
Castle Doorwerth,Roald Nel,4,It was fun to explore the castle. The surrounding area is great for hikes and cycling.
Castle Doorwerth,James Andrews,4,Lovely little castle with friendly staff. The cafe had some lovely food as well. Good for lunch and a visit for a few hours.
Kasteel Rijnhuizen,Dwayne Castillion,5,😍 AMAZING!
Kasteel Rijnhuizen,Ayesha Salahuddin,5,A wonderful experience!
Kasteel Rijnhuizen,BabesCoffee Team,5,Beautifully renovated castle! Truly a discovered gem! Ideal for events.
Kasteel Rijnhuizen,Maaike Walinga - van Dam,5,"Great location for weddings, company parties, birthdays, can be used for anything! Also an opportunity to walk around the estate, which is beautifully landscaped."
Kasteel Rijnhuizen,Jelle van Keulen,5,"Dream location, a hidden gem and mega easily accessible 👌"
Hotel Au Vieux Durbuy,Menno van der Steen,5,"Very nice hotel from the same owners as the Victoria hotel. So there is the checkin and breakfast located. Just a short walk. Lea has elegant rooms, well designed and with very comfortable beds. Great place to start your walks through Durbuy and it’s surroundings."
Hotel Au Vieux Durbuy,Margarita Constantinou,1,"Part of maison cardinael  Very dissapointed. The price-quality range is unheard of. For an extortionate amount of money, we were offered a small sized room with two small windows. Felt like a prison  They allowed us to move to a room as advertised on their site, only to find hair in every corner of the bathroom.  The people that work there are definitely not the friendliest, and do not show any flexibility to those who don’t speak French (fluently.) some of the staff were just blatantly rude.  The food and the restaurant was very good. I would recommend it for a nice evening with good food.  The hotel and staff I would definitely NOT recommend, and we will not be staying here again."
Hotel Au Vieux Durbuy,Travis Finkle,3,"Definitely not a 4* hotel as they advertise. I booked a room with two beds and the room only had 1 bed. They said none of the rooms have two beds, then why do you have this as a booking option. Check in is around the corner at a completely different hotel. Entrance is down a narrow alley around the back then a extremely steep ramp to get inside. It was very hot in the room, there is no shower curtain so water goes everywhere in the bathroom. It was quite loud from the local restaurants and pubs."
Hotel Au Vieux Durbuy,Wella,4,Lovely place inside the beautiful historic narrow streets of Durbuy! It will catch your eyes with its fitting style of furniture. It really resembles the present Ambiance in Durbuy!.
Hotel Au Vieux Durbuy,Mitr Friend,4,Its an adorable 3-star hotel with an old world charm and all modern amenities. It is a part of the 3 hotels chain of Maison Caerdinael. So the check-in check-out and breakfast are at Victoria hotel.
Kasteel Huis Bergh,Andrew Holt,5,"Stumbled upon this by chance, really glad we did,it’s a lovely slice of history and one man’s vision and collection of medieval art and artefacts. Included in the price is a guided tour of the tower which is certainly worth the climb up the narrow stairs."
Kasteel Huis Bergh,aurora,5,Fantastic castle. Working time was untill 16:30 so we have not managed to get inside but still being outside was impresive. There us a cafe with good offer of food and beer
Kasteel Huis Bergh,Mark Holmwood,5,"Visited today with three children. We did the Ridderslag tour. It was great 😁. We all had to dress up in period costume and then under the supervision of a guide we role-played a ""typical"" scenario of the time.  I would definitely recommend it - as long as you don't mind a bit of wife swapping 😉"
Kasteel Huis Bergh,K. Hamami,5,"Great well-maintained castle with rich history. Free admission with Dutch Museum card. We visited the castle at the end of the day and did not need to book our tickets in advance.  You can take the audio tour or the guided tour for the best experience. If you go slow, It could take between 1 - 2 hours max to enjoy the collection and main building.  Good restaurants and a very nice surrounding."
Kasteel Huis Bergh,Tetiana Bogomolova,5,"Wow!!! I didn't expect to see here such a great collection of the middle ages art. The castle itself very beautiful, so don't forget to take camera. They also have a special audio guide with tasks (from 8 y.o.) for children. There is a cafe in the castle's yard."
Doornenburg Castle,M Prins,5,"The tour guide was incredible—spunky, engaging with the kids, thorough, and clearly passionate! The castle itself has been very well restored, and is loaded with nearly 800 years of simple Dutch history.  Stay at the BnB in the castle bailey area, and eat in the cafe! It’s a double-down on the experience!"
Doornenburg Castle,mohamed abdullah,5,Verynice place & nice people. Very friendly. You can check the website to know their agenda. You may Enter the castle free of charge & look around. Very nice castle for history lovers. This castel is before mideveil time.
Doornenburg Castle,Gerben Blom,5,"Great castle, love the cafe/restaurant outside and inside. Cosy atmosphere and great food."
Doornenburg Castle,Jason Zarate,5,"This castle isn't overwhelmingly large, but with the aid of the knowledgable staff, you get a glimpse into its past as the stronghold at this strategic point where 3 rivers meet in the countryside. The bridge leads you high over the functioning moat into a hall that features a painting of Doornenburg in a dilapidated state, 10 years after the last mistress of the castle died. It's history is an interesting one, including a less than fortunate incident in WW2.  The is armor on display, the bedroom and great hall have arrangements, and nice views are available from every floor. It's worth a visit!"
Doornenburg Castle,J. Collins,5,"If you are a ""Castle"" junkie this one has some incredible history starting c1300. At a closed event we were treated like family. The docents in period costume are well trained and friendly. This is one of the best preserved castles in the NL."
Castle Wissekerke Basel,Elena Alexandra Stiribat,5,Nice views. Nice museum! A lot to learn! I totally recommend. It costs 12 euros if you want to visit the entire museum. Of you don't want to pay you can visit only two rooms.
Castle Wissekerke Basel,Peter,5,Impressive story well told inside this castle. Multi language audio guide makes the most of the visit.
Castle Wissekerke Basel,Johan de Roodt,5,Nice place to take a walk or visit the castle. Beautiful park
Castle Wissekerke Basel,Robin Astle,4,"Very nice audio tour available, also a special version for kids. Really worth visiting!"
Castle Wissekerke Basel,hpchemist,2,"The location is pretty cute but I did not like the food. We had a three course menue. 1. White asparagus with salmon and sauce Hollondaise: The Asparagus was tasteless and not really tender, the sauce was not self made. 2. Filet steak with some vegetables and french fries plus sauce: The steak was not tender and mine was well done while others got more lucky, was very inconsistent. Vegetables I guess deep frozen, which I wouldn't mind but again the sauces were convenience. The steak bothered me the most, though. 3. Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert with vanilla ice cream, was nothing special but fine. The hall where we had the food was quite loud, so one could only understand the next neighbour, I would keep that in mind. The service was helpful. To be honest the great location did not impress me on the food side, unfortunately."
Slot Zeist,Sebastian D'Agostino,5,Beautiful castle and gardens. I was lucky enough to catch a Jazz concert on my afternoon visit.
Slot Zeist,Tristan,5,"Ouders hier getrouwd, met school hier vaak geweest. Veel gespeeld. Veel naar tentoonstellingen geweest.  ""In the midst of his essay, the Unabomber discusses how the use of technology in our everyday lives is detrimental to human experience and the environment, writing: ""The more technology a society has, the more vulnerable it is."" His argument is also rooted in anti-industrialist views, echoing the fear that technological advancements can lead to oppression and control."""
Slot Zeist,LFGaming,3,"Nice to look at the building, but we could not go inside so I don’t know if that is any fun. If you are in Zeist I would take a visit to take a look at the building. Not busy at all when we went."
Slot Zeist,Everdina Carter,4,I didn't get to go inside but it's a beautiful area to walk around and a lovely building. I also really enjoyed the different art sculptures in the park surrounding it. Very fun.
Slot Zeist,Eric B,3,"Could be nice but was closed even though it was mentioned to be open.....probably only for bookings, meetings and similar occasions....the gardens were great and the restaurant good with very friendly staff! 👍"
Koldinghus,Nuno Pereira,5,"Top rating for this castle. Love the way it was done. Recovered from a burned out ruin without overdoing it. Different themes throughout keeping the interest. Spent two hours there and was sorry to have come so close to the closing time, well worth a longer visit"
Koldinghus,Marcel Fromhage,4,"I was positively surprised by the exhibit and really enjoyed it. The story and history of the castle was interesting and well presented. But what really created a special experience was the current exhibit of the Royal Danish dinnerware with hand painted local plants and complete set of the Flora Danica dinnerware from the king's  birthday dinner in 1808. The display was.beautiful and the craftsmanship is amazing.  The exhibit of the ""Dannnebrog"" royal ship inside the castle was interesting and impressive in it's design but still felt a little out of place and blocked the view of some of the fire restaurations which I would have preferred to see."
Koldinghus,Anthony Chan,5,Historic castle that has been rebuilt due to a fire. A lot of interesting exhibitions. Learned a lot about the royal yacht and the activities of the royal family. Has a cafe and play area for kids and also costumes for kids and adults to try. You can climb the tower for some panoramic aerial views of the city.
Koldinghus,JJS,5,Beautiful historical palace. Very informative. It is also nice to stroll around the palace compound.
Koldinghus,Alexander Lofft,4,"Koldinghus has a remarkable and occasionally central place in Danish history. It is a shame that it burned down, but the restoration is remarkable, not in what it recreated (that wasn't the point) but how it displays the echoes of magnificence.  Including other individual exhibits of Danish royal heritage nicely rounds out the experience.  Also, visit the small exhibit in the stable building too (I won't reveal here, but it's worth some time to see)  If you are in the region, it is a must see"
Duyfkens B.V.,Lucas,5,"Very beautiful Zuilen castle, well worth a look."
Gripsholm Castle,Anna Antaya,5,"The castle with its history and beautiful surroundings in Mariefred is well worth a visit. I recommend to do the guided tour and to not miss the lion, the theatre and the beautifully ornamented rooms which used to house Swedish royalty. We brought a picnic and ate it outside which was nice. Plenty of ice cream shops nearby in Mariefred."
Gripsholm Castle,Kajetan Narkiewicz,3,"Great collection of paintings, beautiful gardens and magnificent castle. Unfortunately there is no description of rooms, paintings nor anything. Things are nice to look at but you won't get any context of what you see."
Gripsholm Castle,Ajay Kumar,5,"The well-maintained gardens surrounding the castle add to its allure, providing a serene escape for leisurely strolls and scenic views. From the ornate architecture to the serene ambiance, Gripsholm Slot is a photographer's paradise.  The nostalgic charm of the vintage locomotive combined with the picturesque Swedish countryside made for a memorable journey. The attentive staff on board provided fascinating insights into the history of the train and the surrounding region, enriching the overall experience."
Gripsholm Castle,Krasi Kazashka,4,"Beautiful castle and grounds, the deer park is super nice to visit. Parking is free and there is delicious ice cream truck."
Gripsholm Castle,Selçuk Kalyoncu,5,"Fantastic place to visit and feel the medieval vibes.  You should definitely walk around towards Mariefreds kyrka through small streets.  If you have extra time, energy and means of transportation, you can also connect your trip to Strängnäs which is 20-25 minutes drive."
Häme Castle,Cody Varga,4,"Museum itself was awesome and super cool! Definitely recommend a visit to experience a 900 year old castle!  The gift shop looked like it was really cool, but sadly they closed 20 minutes before the rest of the museum so we didn't get to buy anything :("
Häme Castle,Vipul Kumar,5,"A very nice place to visit and know about history. The castle is well preserved and quite big in Finland. There are 3 floors with different exhibitions related to the history of the castle, Finland and also the wildlife in Finland. Castle can be accessed with single ticket or a combi ticket which includes the prison and museum as well. They also have guided tours at different times in a day."
Häme Castle,Pink Mean,5,Häme Castle is a captivating step into history. Its ancient walls and intricate interiors offer a glimpse into Finland's medieval past. A must-visit for history enthusiasts
Häme Castle,Stanislav Nikitin,5,Museum for the whole day. Fortress is well restored and accessible for even for low mobility categories. Location is in 15 min walking distance from train station. Museum accepts museum card. Good to provide English comments for the whole exhibition.
Häme Castle,Prasanna Kumar,3,"For its worth, it was more of a maze, than something to look at and wonder. It's pretty new when compared to Turku Castle. So it's brick construction, mostly in shambles, some quarters renovated. The courtyard and its balcony kind of leads to almost all around the castle. You have a chance to try out crusade armour or pilgrim dresses and click photos."
Hoensbroek Castle,Praveen Kumar Srivastava,5,Located at a nice place but there was no jungle near this castle. You have to buy tickets to get entry here. There are nothing special inside the castle. You can visit TerWorm which is not so far from this castle.  Overall a worthy visit.
Hoensbroek Castle,Colin Knubben,5,"Its a great place to visit if you like history! I came here with my partner and didn't have a clue what to do or see, but when we went in it was a blast. I had loads of fun looking at the old history, nice architecture and amazing story telling and backstory of every accessible room."
Hoensbroek Castle,Milena Felipe Luna,1,"My experience at Kasteel Hoensbroek was a bit disappointing, as the interior did not live up to the grandeur of the castle's exterior beauty. Although the castle itself is massive, only a small portion is open to the public. I found many artificial displays geared towards tourists, lacking the authenticity I had hoped for. Regrettably, there was a lack of original exhibits that would have delighted castle lovers, apart from the maids' life display. I felt the absence of a more royalty touch and an opportunity to explore the castle's history in a genuine and captivating way ¡Muchas gracias! 17/07/23"
Hoensbroek Castle,Kuriakos Koukakis,5,"Hoensbroek Castle (Dutch: Kasteel Hoensbroek) or Gebrook Castle (Dutch: Gebrookhoes) is one of the largest castles in the Netherlands. It is situated in Hoensbroek, a town in the province of Limburg. This imposing watercastle is known as 'the most lordly stronghold between Rhine and Meuse'. The oldest part of the castle, notably the tall round tower, dates from around 1360, when it was built by Herman Hoen, though a predecessor to the castle had already existed in the swamp (or Gebrook) the castle was located in. This so-called motte-and-bailey dated from around 1225. In 1250 a fortified manor was built on the location of the present castle. Because of its important strategical location in the Duchy of Brabant, located along important trading routes to Maastricht, Aachen and Cologne, the castle was expanded in several phases, becoming the largest stronghold between the Meuse and the Rhine rivers. It contains at least 67 halls, rooms and living quarters."
Hoensbroek Castle,P. Baars,5,"Truly beautiful castle with a very clear guided tour that takes you to all the interesting spots. Fun stuff for kids to do and interesting stuff for the parents. Not too busy while we visited, which was also a blessing. Definitely a good way to spend a day."
Kasteel Ammersoyen,Matilde Falardo Garcia,5,"REVIEW OF KASTEEL VISIT  Museumkaart valid!  The Kasteel has staff inside that are acting as people from the medieval times. It’s a truly great experience!  The staff is SUPER NICE and actually VERY passionate about the kasteel. They truly know all the details of what happened there and tell you the story with excitement and a good mood.  We got there only 1 hour before it was closing and didn’t speak Dutch, so a very nice staff gave us a private tour in English (even though everyone speaks English! This was only because we wouldn’t be able to see everything and know everything on a tour by ourselves in 1 hour).  Save at least 2 hours to go!! We got there at 16h (closes at 17h) because online it recommended 1hour. But that’s not enough. And some rooms were already closed / staff was already packing to leave even before 17h (very typical of Dutch). So I’d recommend going after lunch or before, but not as we did close to the closing time.  The cafe stays open after the kasteel. And it’s very nice and spacious.  Reaching by public transport is also ok. You just need to take a nice 10 minute walk from the bus. And take into consideration they only come every half hour / hour. It’s a bit expensive (3,3€ from Den Bosch each way) but worth it!  Tip: ask to see the “prison” ;)"
Kasteel Ammersoyen,alexandra diana rus,5,"Was very positively surprised by this castle - we spent 1.5hr as we dedicated lots of time reading the info from the QR codes and the existing panels. You can also try armory in one of the chambers and see how heavy they are. There were not many visitors in the castle, so it felt like we have it for ourselves - this castle definitely deserves more visitors though :)"
Kasteel Ammersoyen,bert kraan,4,Book a XL tour if you can! Access to more area's and a great story from an experienced guide
Kasteel Ammersoyen,Michaël Kooter,4,The interior of the castle is still being transformed back into it's shape from the past. Very nice experience with guides and people playing the occupants from medieval times. Nice and educational activity for a rainy afternoon :)
Kasteel Ammersoyen,Dirk van der Lee,4,Well preserved castle that you can visit for a small price. Also has a café attached in the other buildings.
A.S.F.A. Annex (καλλιτεχνικός σταθμός Α.Σ.Κ.Τ.),Romio,4,It takes you to old times. Definitely worth it to a visit.
La Loggia Del Castello,Elisabeth B,5,"Excellent location, clean and pretty rooms. Family run with 9(!) homemade cakes for breakfast. The breakfast was enough to keep us going all day with eggs, bacon and local cheeses and saussages."
La Loggia Del Castello,Stephan Holzner,5,Was there end of Oct 2019.  Wonderful breakfast and nice hosts.
La Loggia Del Castello,Francisco Kiss,5,Wonderful bed and breakfast. Will try to stay there if I come back to Trento
La Loggia Del Castello,Rob Brokenhouse,5,wonderful
La Loggia Del Castello,Midi,5,"Staff welcoming, polite, smiling, friendly and helpful. The BB is well cared for and equally the beautiful and clean room. The breakfast is super: plentiful, good. It satisfies both those who cheer for the sweet and those who cheer for the salty. Excellent service. La Loggia is located in a strategic point: in front of the Castello del Buonconsiglio, it is just a few minutes from the station and the city centre. A BB now of reference and which I highly recommend for those wishing to visit Trento and spend some days in peace."
Chillon Castle,Pam V,4,"Fascinating to see the restored work done through the centuries, 1100s forward. So amazing to be able to walk through a maze of courtyards, covered bridges and rooms while experiencing the historical presence of the structure.  Accompanying furnishings are thoughtfully curated and arranged, complemented by painted walls from appropriate periods in history.  I didn't get an eerie feeling (although I skipped the dungeon and crypt), as I have before when visiting such a structure. Rather, I felt as if I could possibly have lived there during that time period!"
Chillon Castle,Joejoe Abi,5,"Took the self guided audio tour and learned so much about this historic castle and its famous prisoners.  Beautifully set on a moat on Lake Geneva, it is well worth an afternoon visit to stroll its walls and see its enchanting views all the way up the highest tower."
Chillon Castle,Meth Herath,5,Located near one of the most beautiful lakes overlooking the alps. A historic castle that has a lot of areas to explore explore including an underground section. This is a very busy place during summer. Go all the way to the top to get a great view.. need about 1 hour or more to enjoy. But note that the parking here is limited and may fill out.
Chillon Castle,Luke Goh,5,"From most of my castle or fort tours, usually some parts of the area are cordoned off or sold as a different experience. But found that the Chillon castle experience had none of that nonsense with 90% of the castles rooms available for public viewing. If you are expecting paintings and all the artisan displays like those found in other castles, you would not find it here. Free with the Swiss pass and provides a glimpse into the past of the Geneva region. I found the history about the fall of the castle very intriguing, but I will leave that part for you to find out during your visit to the castle! (No spoilers)"
Chillon Castle,Reza Nickmanesh,5,A beautiful island castle located in lake Geneva with interesting history. The castle has various sections showing different functionalities the castle have had in the past. Make sure to take the stairs to climb up the castle to get an incredible view. There were also galleries inside the castle showcasing antique crafts & objects.
Castillo de Coca,Jason Reeve,5,"Amazing. One of the best stops on my Spanish trip. I hired a car in Madrid and drove out to Coca to visit this stunning castle. Not only was it visually incredible, but it was also fully accessible, I was able to walk the walls inside and out, explore the interior, and even climb up and out onto the roof. If that's not amazing enough, I was able to do that was barely anyone else present as the castle is aittle off the beaten path. The town of Coca is definitely worth a wander too, it's beautiful and historic - even scoring a mention in the Astrix and Obelisk comics. Definitely one of my highlights!"
Castillo de Coca,Barrie Hall,5,A really interesting  place to visit with information provided in English and an English speaking man on reception. It must be said that the stairs up the towers are challenging with large risers and no hand rails. But we are two 74 year old not particularly fit pensioners and we managed OK. It is really worth the effort.
Castillo de Coca,Jacek Marcinkowski,5,"It’s very well preserved castle from old times. City itself has not much to offer, nearby are some nice cheap restaurants. I do like castles so i am visiting various ones around."
Castillo de Coca,tradinomad,4,Very authentic castle still untouched by the masses. There’s a nice self guided walking tour climbing up quite a big amount of tall steps that showcase the convergence of Mudejar design and Gothic architecture.
Castillo de Coca,Richard Buck,5,Unbelievable place really worth the trip One of the better castles in Spain in my opinion and sadly missed by many as they hurtle North - South on motorways. So worthwhile taking longer to make a trip and enjoy Spains best kept secret - it’s interior.
Trakoscan Castle,Paul Heller,5,"Beautifully restored castle located near the border with Slovenia. While I didn't go inside, I just stopped on the side of the road for some drone pictures. It looks like it's a big tourist destination as there is a restaurant on site and some souvenirs. Probably worth while to go inside. It sits atop a hill and normally there is a lake to walk around, but its currently being cleaned and under construction."
Trakoscan Castle,Borut B,5,"Trakoščan Castle was built at the end of the 13th century as a smaller castle (burg), the builder and the exact time of construction is unknown. The castle is beautifully decorated, the surroundings are well maintained, the lake or rather the pond next to the castle was empty in April 2023, probably due to the lack of rain and maintenance work due to cleaning the silt in the lake. Photography is otherwise prohibited in the castle, except in the areas pointed out by the guide. This applies to the rooms with pictures, where photography is prohibited due to the protection of the heritage, but you can take photos in the rooms with weapons, hunting trophies and of course the exterior of the castle. The staff is extremely friendly and offers a wealth of useful information. Nice experience. I recommend it to everyone who is in the area up to, say, 80 km. You won't regret it. That's why you're here."
Trakoscan Castle,Mike Oldnall,4,Great castle with free audio tour in many languages using a smartphone. Entry a very reasonable €7. Walk round lake (5km) nice but limited appeal until they finish clearing and refill!!
Trakoscan Castle,Alex BP,5,"Trakošćan Castle, a well-maintained Croatian gem, boasts a unique blend of architectural styles. Explore cool weaponry & immerse in its rich history."
Trakoscan Castle,Petra Fodor,5,We enjoyed this place a lot. Very nice castle and museum.
Heidelberg Palace,Chris H,5,This castle is located atop a hill with beautiful views of Heidelberg. There are several displays inside showing what early pharmaceutical equipment was like. You can walk to the top of the biggest wine barrel you will ever see. There is a large open area where you can sit in the shade and enjoy the views. Food is available at a couple of different places on the castle grounds. The castle is accessible by foot (a little bit of a climb) or by train (tickets are available for purchase). You could easily spend a couple hours here.
Heidelberg Palace,Carlos Herrada,5,Beautiful castle. One of the most complete one I've seen so far but the location on the river is phenomenal. The garden just wow. The history and the story behind it just good. I didn't post pics of the castle because I'm in it.
Heidelberg Palace,Corey,5,The views and history of the castle is so amazing! Definitely a must visit! So many things to see and take in! There’s a great lawn to just sit out and relax in and enjoy the day.  Tickets are needed for entry.
Heidelberg Palace,Mia,5,"Such a nice place! Both the castle and the gardens are worth a visit. You can access the gardens for free but will have to pay to enter the courtyard. Adult ticket is 9€ (August 23), which also includes access to the funicular going up and down. You'll need to pay an extra 6€ if you want to actually enter the castle which is only available through guided tours."
Heidelberg Palace,Oleksandra Silik,5,"Very nice old palace, you should definitely walk around and visit the garden. All the surrounding are accessible for free. But the entrance to the courtyard costs 9 euros. It’s unreasonably expensive, on my opinion. The size of the yard and what you can see inside is not worth the money. The yard is really small and partially closed for restoration, some cars are parked in places, there are too many people...  In addition, to get inside the castle you need to pay even more and book a tour. So I was very disappointed. But again, the castle itself is spectacular and worth to visit, just consider thoroughly whether you need to go in. As an advantage, free toilet next to the cash register😉"
Castle De Haar,Duru E.,4,"The biggest castle in the Netherlands with astonishing gardens! Even though I visited here on a rainy summer day, it was a peaceful walk through the gardens. I was not super impressed by the interior, the kitchen looks dazzling though! The history of the castle is also interesting to read/watch.  I find it also pretty easy to reach by public transportation, there is a bus stop right in front of the castle. It is free to visit with the Museumkaart!"
Castle De Haar,Mahdiyar N.H.Gilani,5,"I had an great experience visiting Castle De Haar! 🏰✨ Despite the slightly higher costs, the grandeur and beauty of the castle and its surroundings made it well worth it.  The sheer size of the castle was huge. Its magnificent architecture and meticulous attention to detail transported me to a bygone era. Exploring the lavishly decorated rooms and expansive gardens was like stepping into a fairytale. The picturesque surroundings added to the enchantment, creating a truly magical atmosphere. 🌳🌷🌞  While the ticket prices may be on the higher side, the exceptional quality and maintenance of the castle make it clear why. The staff's commitment to preserving the historical significance and beauty of Castle De Haar is evident in every corner. 📚🗺️  Well worth a visit if you are in Utrech or close by. It's a perfect destination for history enthusiasts, architecture lovers, and anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable adventure. If you're willing to indulge in a slightly higher-cost experience, I highly recommend exploring the grandeur and charm of Castle De Haar. You won't be disappointed! ✨🏰💫"
Castle De Haar,Scott Forrester,5,"Great experience for the family, the entire property is just stunning and having the ability to walk through the castle and all the grounds is great. Kids loved the maze. Staff were friendly and of course so knowledgeable. We also had lunch at the cafe and the quality/service was on par with an external restaurant."
Castle De Haar,Jeroen de Graaf,5,"A true awesome Castle in The Netherlands. Do visit the Garden and the Castle. But most important, it is good to read the history and heritage before you enter the Castle. This gives you a good image of the Castle and the building next to the Castle. This building is still in ownership of the family and they do visit it very often. The garden is beautiful and completed with several small items from the past. Enjoy this view and the environment via the two restaurants and cafe! Enjoy and I will for sure be back to enjoy this place."
Castle De Haar,Altuğ Bakan,5,Amazing castle and park which makes you feel like you are inside a fairy tale. There are a lot of things to do around and the history of the castle is pretty interesting. The garden is pretty huge and there is even a maze and a deer park you can visit. I believe this is one of the top visits in the Netherlands.
Standesamt,Piotr Chruślicki,5,Beautiful Place. Well worth a visit perfect for a day trip.
Standesamt,2019,5,"We were given very courteous advice in advance. This adequate course of action ran like a red thread until the wedding Both colleagues helped us individually and sincerely with our necessary bureaucratic steps in the marriage. The numerous offers of help and support were particularly pleasant. In addition, there was a precise breakdown of the costs in advance.  Clearly - a great recommendation. We wish the team many more weddings."
Standesamt,Marcin Jaworski,5,You have to see !!!!
Standesamt,Rafał Rybicki,5,Lovely place. There is more to see and explore on the German side
Standesamt,Jarosław Zaporowski,5,"Great, I recommend a very beautiful place, accessible to everyone, you can go everywhere by bike. Lots of greenery around, you can take your family and have a picnic. Very nice neighborhood. Very close to the Polish border.  Great, I recommend a very beautiful place, accessible to everyone, you can ride your bike everywhere. Around a lot of greenery, you can take your family and take a picnic. Very nice neighbourhood. Very close to the Polish border."
Dunrobin Castle & Gardens,Lauren Hughes,5,"A stunning place to visit. Make sure you have plenty of time to explore the building, the museum and the gardens (and to wait in the toilet queue, the public facilities aren’t the best in that regard). The toilet thing is easy to ignore though. It’s well worth it. Dogs welcome in the surrounding grounds, but not inside the castle or the garden (given there’s a falconry there, too)."
Dunrobin Castle & Gardens,Ian Fidler,5,"In short, visit this place. Fascinating history told by the many rooms. Avoid taking in a backpack or rucksack as they won't let you take it round (leave in a car or deposit with the Castle). Gardens are gorgeous and take in the museum which is in another building in the gardens. Café is nice, too."
Dunrobin Castle & Gardens,Clare Warrilow,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Dunrobin Castle & Gardens. The Castle is beautiful with a fascinating history & beautiful interior to explore, & the gardens were stunning. We especially enjoyed the falconry display which my son was lucky enough to be asked to help with. All of the staff were friendly & helpful & the coffee & cakes in the tearoom were delicious."
Dunrobin Castle & Gardens,Jayne Brownsword,5,"Wonderful day out. The falconry show was brilliant, the Falconer was very informative and shared a lot of great facts. The museum was interesting but disturbing at the same time."
Dunrobin Castle & Gardens,Malcolm Hinton,5,Stunning  castle with family & historic heir looms. It does contain a large number of stag & deer heads & a few wild cat skins. There is a cafe inside  with a varied menu. Fantastic falconry display with humour & factual content.  The birds show their agility & hunting skills.  Beautiful gardens with views of the Moray Firth.
Moritzburg Castle,Varsha Mehta,5,"It's one of the most beautiful places to exist. The whole atmosphere is so calming and peaceful. Sitting by the lake, with the wind blowing and the weather, it was such an ethereal experience.  It's definitely a must visit place."
Moritzburg Castle,Uğurcan Türe,5,It is one of the most beautiful castles in the state of Saxony. It is built on top of an artificial island and is named after Duke Moritz. The surroundings of the castle were used as a hunting area. It is not far from Dresden. It is easily accessible by car. There are also parking lots around. There are both free and paid exhibits inside.
Moritzburg Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"Moritzburg Castle - The castle where the beloved fairy tale movie of the 70s, 3 Nuts for Cinderella, was filmed, a majestic square-shaped castle in the middle of a lake. A tour of the castle is organized with the help of an interactive tablet guide, where you can read interesting information, and also see the inhabitants of the castle on the screen. Many thanks to the organizers of such an interactive show. There are few of parking lots, payable. Entrance to the castle costs 12 euros. Interesting and educational!"
Moritzburg Castle,Sylwana Sikorska-Kupis,5,"Tour with a histopad guide device is an amazing experience full of history and fun/ treasure hunt included/. One can be a part of big royal dinners and take a selfie as the monarch with the use of  the device-great! Breathtaking views of  the palace surrounded by lakes with a lighthouse and a port, can you believe it!"
Moritzburg Castle,Evgenia P,5,"Amazing place, I enjoyed the castle, the water around, and the park. In addition, they have great gide on ipads, which is very interesting."
Leeds Castle,kartik shah,5,"Absolutely amazing castle, some very nice & beautiful views, worth the ticket cost.  Castle tour is very good, informative and helpful communication,  Flowers not maintained well in  the garden and looks really untidy and unattractive - need lots of TLC , worth of money because Easy to spend a whole day there, and standard tickets allow for free re-entry for the year."
Leeds Castle,Sean Mayes,5,"We visited for the Christmas lights festival. We usually go to Bedgebury, but this was closer to us and more convenient.  We all felt it was easily on par with the latter, and we had a great time walking around the grounds exploring all the sites.  Movement throughout the grounds was smooth and painless. Staff worked well to ensure this was successful. Parking was also very easy and quick.  We'd definitely visit again next year."
Leeds Castle,Jason T,5,"Beautiful castle to visit! Get your walking shoes on because it’s quite a walk from the parking area to the castle. It’s a lovely walk though through the gardens. Just beautiful. They do have a mobility bus for those that need it. There is a well laid out, self guided tour.  Enjoy!"
Leeds Castle,Jorita Schosswald,5,"Beautiful and well-preserved castle. Stunning interior. Alarms everywhere. It's definitely worth a visit. The premises are gorgeous too. Beautiful and well maintained gardens. After closing hours, when staying at the courtyard, you're allowed to wander around. Great. No people cluttering your photos. The best spot for sunset pictures is the golf court. But golfers will not be pleased if you wander there."
Leeds Castle,Ellen Southfield,5,"We went for my 30th birthday. Every single member of staff were absolutely lovely, friendly people who seemed happy to be at work. The castle itself is very interesting and the grounds/gardens are beautiful. We went on the boat and the train and would definitely recommend both as they are a bit of fun. We bought swan/duck food with us, but they sell bags there and all the money from the bags goes towards caring for the swans/ducks, which I love! We LOVED the birds of prey bit. The show was interesting and made us laugh a few times. They also have a bit later on where you can meet a couple of the birds. All the staff there were very talkative and again very friendly. It all really made for a very special birthday and I cannot thanl everyone there enough! I wasn't wearing my birthday badge or tell anyone, so they were just nice because they were nice.  We went back again 3 weeks later and again all the staff were completely wonderful. It was raining this time but we still really enjoyed ourselves and it was still absolutely beautiful even in the rain.  We bought a yearly ticket and I cant wait to go back again!"
Trosky State Castle,Siewling Lay,3,The entrance fee was not cheap so I was expecting more information and better infrastructure. Also you have to pay for parking. The castle was honestly more impressive from far and there were way too many people on a weekend. Maybe a weekday visit will be better.
Trosky State Castle,R.A.,5,"Great views from up the tower. Quite a cool ruined Castle with a very cheap entry fee of only 140 or 120 crowns, cards are accepted which is nice since we had no cash on us."
Trosky State Castle,Lore Clauw,4,"Nice ruins of an old castle on top of a hill. About 10 minutes walk from the parking lot, you could enter without going on a tour. It takes about 45 minutes to see everything. With nice wide views from the battlements. I recommend going there if you're in the neighbourhood but don't go out of your way to visit."
Trosky State Castle,Dinh Tuan,5,"Located some 10 km south of Semily - Liberec Region and being one of the most visited sights of the Czech Republic, Trosky is a ruins of a Gothic castle founded in the late 14th century and it became the main symbols of the whole Bohemian Paradise area (Český ráj) for its unique appearance and origin. The siting of the castle on two steep basalt volcanic made Trosky unconquerable as many enemies failed to capture it. However, no fortress can resist the hands of time, so even Trosky, abandoned in the late 15th century, began to gradually fall into ruin.  The castle was founded in the late middle ages, approximately between 1380 and 1390, when the owner of the domain, Čeněk (Lord) of Wartenberg, used the natural defensive features of the basalt rocks. He founded the inner castle with residential palaces on the ridge between both summits, and used the summits for defensive towers also with residential facilities.  The lower summit is 47 m high, called “The Crone” due to its stout appearance, bore the hexagonal two-storey building, accessible from the northern side of the palace. On the higher and slender summit, “The Maiden”, a rectangular palace was built, originally with three floors, allegedly containing the castle chapel. The height of the Maiden above the first courtyard is approximately 57 m made it possible to build a defense system that made the inner castle inaccessible, and provided unlimited all-round view of the castle, its slopes, and wide area around it.  The defensive system consisted of three circles of ramparts, 1.5 to 2 m wide and up to 15 m high. All the courtyards are reinforced by sandstone blocks.  The palaces were only inhabited on the upper floors, and the lower floors provided enough storage space for supplies necessary under siege. Water was drawn from the castle’s own well (30 m deep) on the first courtyard, and from an elaborate system of rainwater tanks was built in the rock at the Maiden.  Thanks to its romantic atmosphere and unique silhouette it became a popular tourist destination in the 19th century and soon received the most necessary repairs. Currently, the castle is managed by the National Heritage Institute based in Pardubice.  * Some photos courtesy of Internet. Thanks!"
Trosky State Castle,Tomas Sabol,5,Legendary castle ruin with wonderful views. Its typical shape rises above picturesque landscape. It would be nice if they enabled full access to the higher tower.
Alanya Castle,Anil,3,"It is nice to see great views. The people that live up there and also in the shops are really nice, not because they want to sell you stuff. It is even cheaper to buy from the stores at the castle. The castle itself is nice to see, not the most special thing to do, but a good addition to your holiday. Be prepared you will walk a lot in the sun."
Alanya Castle,Elena Kropaneva,5,"Amazing place to wonder around. There is a flower smell in the air, seaview points, beautiful ancient ruins. It is pity that the historical information is written mostly in Turkish, not in English. It is a place not for one time, because of so many paths to walk and objects to explore."
Alanya Castle,Diana Maria Cioca,5,"A beautiful place to visit, great views from most of the places.We had a refreshing orange juice at a nice place up there. Some corners could be cleaner, the grass cut in order to make the access easier for the tourists.The view is breathtaking and the cable car not expensive."
Alanya Castle,yannick lohmann,5,"You have a pretty nice view from up there. In the castle, you can find little shops, a museum, lots of very friendly cats and impressive architecture. But be aware, in summer the tropical heat on this mountain hits different, so be prepared."
Alanya Castle,Martin Hettervik,4,"Well-kept castle, with a beautiful view of the sea and Alanya. There are walkways through the castle, making it easy to walk and enjoy the scenery. That being said, this closed off part of the castle is not much different from the open free-entrance parts of the castle, making me miss a bit ""more"" with regard to the entrance fee, but still worth a visit."
Prague Castle Picture Gallery,Martin Bumbál,2,"This gallery is absolutely not worth the money. It's just three rooms and the paintings are not that great (there are very little exceptions, which are as well not worth the whole experience) compared to what you can see in such galleries in other European major cities. On top of that, the staff watching over you is really passive-aggressive and make you feel like you are committing a crime by just watching the artworks which they are presenting.  Consider spending a little more and visit the National Museum at the top of Wenceslas square (Václavské náměstí)."
Prague Castle Picture Gallery,Florian S.,1,Staff kicked us out after we wanted to find a dry place during the huge thunderstorm. They absolutely didn't care. Is this Czeck hospitality?
Prague Castle Picture Gallery,Eugene,1,"3 rooms and few dozens of artworks - not exciting, would imagine it should be included into general castle ticket Avoid"
Prague Castle Picture Gallery,Justine,4,"Small gallery with very interesting exhibits. Definitely worth seeing of you are interested in art and old masters. Only few rooms, probably around hour to see all. Could be added to castle visit. Building also has own ticket desk selling all tickets to castle area - usually without the line (closed during Corona)."
Prague Castle Picture Gallery,pawkom pawkom,2,No interesting art. Fully not worth the price
Schloss Eggenberg: Münzkabinett,Javier David Martín Romera,4,"Tiny but adequate collection of coins. However, everything was in Deutsch so I could not understand much.  Edit: apparently they have a leaflet, ""The Coín Cabinet"" in English where they explain things from the exhibition. However, I didn't find it during my visit so I can't really talk about it."
Schloss Eggenberg: Münzkabinett,No Name,5,Interesting and well made exhibition!
Schloss Eggenberg: Münzkabinett,Ákos Keppel,5,"A very interesting and interactive exhibition from the collection of coins related to the history of the castle. With the digitized magnifying glass, we can see the given medal and the historical period on a monitor! It is worth entering the castle with a combined ticket and then you won't miss out on the coin collection. Anyway, it's roughly a quarter-hour program."
Schloss Eggenberg: Münzkabinett,Leo Suppan,4,My walking lap is between 5000 to 7200 daily Steps. To preserve mine Health.
Schloss Eggenberg: Münzkabinett,lobodia sbo,5,"It is very worth knowing and participating in the guided tour, which is in English."
Rocchetta Mattei,Joseph Nye,3,"Visually stimulating place in a beautiful locale, with bizarre, fantastical architecture. Be warned though; Unless you want to walk up a long, narrow country road up hill in the sun, you are intirely at the mercy of a bus service that stops about 3 times a day and not at any time that aligners with the castle's admission hours. There is also nowhere to wait once you are up there. Again, the actual place is very interesting but, unless you have a car, you NEED to plan in advance or risk bring stranded in the middle of nowhere."
Rocchetta Mattei,Torsten Sack,5,"Found it while browsing places to visit in the area. We arrived there without reservation, but the lady at the ticket shop squeezed us into a tour with only 15min waiting time - thanks for that! The castle itself is very picturesc, with sometimes unbelievable amounts of details to discover. We enjoyed the stay a lot!"
Rocchetta Mattei,Esteban Bourguignon,2,"Looks sooooo unique and gorgeous.. but only open in weekends... Even in high season... We could only catch a glipse, very sad"
Rocchetta Mattei,Marco Manfroni,5,"Located in the outskirts of the metropolitan city of Bologna in the little town of Riola. Amazing views and a truly magnificent structure ritch with history and interesting backstories about it's founder and tenet. A place not to miss if you happen to have some time on your hands and want to explore places around Bologna. Easily accessible by train or by car. If you happen to chose the train you can easily get one from Bologna Central station, you then need to get off at Riola station from which the Rocchetta is just a few minutes by foot up a hill (not too steep)."
Rocchetta Mattei,Hitomate packbag,5,"Very Unique, interesting story and beautiful castle. Nature universe inspired design. Highly recommend to visit."
Castello Aragonese,balkissa kane,5,"A nice afternoon visit to do with kids, or as adults only. Fabtastic views from the castle. The guided tour is only in Italian but englidh and french explanations on board available inside. I hope soon it can be in english as well. The kids loved it a d so did we. NB: you have to call before getting in to book a time slot. The person on the phone speaks in english to book a slot.  Here is the number to call before: +390997753438"
Castello Aragonese,Roberto Buzzi,4,It’s a superb fortress that can be visited only with a guide tour every hour between 09.00 AM and 02 AM (closed between 1.00 and 1.50 PM for lunch).
Castello Aragonese,Hanna Kelman,5,"Funny friendly staff that helped us a lot, as we didn’t understand the process of booking. The castle was beautiful in the evening; great view from the top and near the water. We didn’t know Italian, so we understand 10% of the the info from the guide during the excursion. But she was very artistic and passionate. :)"
Castello Aragonese,John Hampson,5,"Taranto, Castello Aragonese, free to enter, lots of steps, very informative info boards in English highlight of the town!"
Castello Aragonese,Heidy Rivero,5,"Very entertaining visit and very interesting history. Definitely a must go The tour is free but you need to book a slot, they have the number in the website They have tours even at night"
Caerlaverock Castle,Butch Dingle,5,"Have been here in the past but was not able to enter the castle due to the ongoing restoration works. Entry is free for English Heritage members* (*Valid membership that has been active for one year or over). The castle is small but boasts some great architecture and it's triangular shape is unique to other castles I have visited. You are able to view the majority of the interior however, at the time of my visit, the East wing of the castle was still under renovation so was inaccessible. The site also has a tea room and shop which is reasonably priced along with a small outdoor play area. There is also a walking trail that has AR plaques that provide historical information as you progress. The trail also leads you to the ruins of the old Castle which was established in the 1220s (more foundations than ruins). Further out there are amazing walks and bird hides. If you are in Dumfries I would highly recommend a visit to this historic castle."
Caerlaverock Castle,"Ian, Jac, Wispa & Hugo",5,"A lovely visit, very nice gift shop where we had some nice small tubs of local ice cream. It was a sunny day when we visited and although the castle is closed for repairs you can still have a pleasant walk around it’s perimeter. An unusual triangular design. Staff very nice in the gift shop. Good toilets and a reasonable car park. Just a nice place to chill. It’s free too, well for now whilst the repairs are being undertaken which look as if they could take some time. There looks to be longer country walks too from the edges of the castle that we didn’t explore as we were only passing through."
Caerlaverock Castle,M Spooner,4,"Greeted by very pleasant staff and made to feel welcome. Castle and grounds are great. For our first stay in Scotland and our first castle visit, was very happy with the visit and history. Nice history video presentation too."
Caerlaverock Castle,Anna Besford,5,"an interesting place to visit not only in terms of history but also recreation. The castle is currently closed to visitors, but is due to reopen - when? - not known yet. You can walk around the castle to admire its architecture. Around a lot of green area where you can lie down and relax on a blanket. There is also a play area for children, a gift shop and very good latte coffee for £2. Free parking, lying on a blanket and watching the castle from the outside as well for free. Enjoy"
Caerlaverock Castle,Amy Hoffmann,5,"A little cafe with reasonable priced drinks (coffees and hot chocolates were £2 at the time of our visit) I love castles that you can wander in, still having a structure of some of the rooms. Staff were friendly, and there was also a playpark. Dogs are allowed on lead, too, so was nice to bring my four-legged friend with us for a wander. Good selection of items in the gift shop also."
Eilean Donan Castle,Jeremy Riley,4,"An iconic Scottish castle in a beautiful setting. Better preserved than many castles, it's been very well maintained. Parking was difficult with the car park full but we found a spot in the village and walked over. The visitor's centre was outside the castle and the shop and cafe were excellent. We had a mix of homemade food and packaged sandwiches and all were good."
Eilean Donan Castle,aliambo,5,"Absolutely gorgeous. Seeing the castle from the drive in was stunning. Getting inside and walking around learning about the history was so much fun. The little ones, ages 3 and 5 enjoyed it as well! It doesn't take much time to walk through while reading and learning about the history of the castle. We also had a lovely lunch in the Cafe and bought a book and some hats from the shop!"
Eilean Donan Castle,Stephanie Harris,5,"Such a wonderous place, So many beautiful rooms, it has a very beautiful view around the castle. Tickets are first come first serve. You cannot purchase them ahead of time. They do not allow backpacks or bags. They have lockers where you can lock them up. Best bet. Leave them in your car. No photos allowed inside the castle."
Eilean Donan Castle,Chris Kelly,4,Stunning views and good facilities. The castle was used in the opening scene of Highlander and has a great history. Little hidden scanning opportunities using QR codes that tell some cracking wee stories. I only gave 4* as you are not allowed to take photos of the inside. There was some cool stuff to snap. I also felt a little conflicted about the feel of the place. It was renovated in the 1900s and needed to be but somehow now has the feel of a 1970s bedsit. So much of the heritage seems to have been lost in the renovation.
Eilean Donan Castle,Stella O'Leary,3,"Very busy! A beautiful castle 🏰 with stunning scenery. It was crowded inside the castle, didn't have time to read the information without being jostled and you can't take photos inside. Enjoyed a coffee and shortbread in the cafe."
Castle Zvíkov,Idan Versano,5,A great castle to visit. It is on a peninsula and is perfect to visit when crossing the Czech republic to the South. Parking costs 100 czk and then it takes 5 min easy walking to the castle. The views are great. From down the castle there is a ferry boat we didn't take but it could be fun. Check the web for its routes. The nearby castle is Oarlik which is 20 min. away by car
Castle Zvíkov,Kevin Hacker,5,Love this castle. Should have spent a little more time there. It is self guided so take your time!
Castle Zvíkov,Thomas S. Iversen,5,"Fantastic castle experience..  Very nice exhibitions and very good nature. The castle is not great like castle Orlík, and not as big as a showoff of wealth and majesty,  but really nice in its own,  better,  way 😊"
Castle Zvíkov,Evgenia P,5,"My favorite castle due to great nature - two rivers Vltava and Otava - around. Amazing place, not too famous and, therefore, not crowded"
Castle Zvíkov,Holly,4,"Quiet and very beautiful riverside views! Just an hour’s drive from Prague, it is ideal place for hiking and visiting with family or friends on weekends."
Walmer Castle and Gardens,Diane Boswell,5,I love this castle. It is my absolute favorite one. The Gardens are beautiful. The woodland walk is wonderful and full of little playareas for the kids. There are a number of excellent cafes. The staff knowledgeable about it's history and very friendly. The castle wonderful and it's battlements have wonderful views
Walmer Castle and Gardens,marlene womack,5,"I visited the Castle twice in a week.  My daughter came with me on the second visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and hope to go again to explore more of the history of the castle. The Castle and gardens are so beautiful and colourful. There is so much history involved in the building and there is so much to see and learn. The woodland areas are inviting and a good place to relax and have a picnic. There are play areas for children. There is a gift shop, tea rooms, toilet facilities and parking. I have invested in a membership card which opens up the options of future visits and to other places too."
Walmer Castle and Gardens,Natasha G,5,"Great day out. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and it's a wonderful time going for a stroll while imagining the Queen Mother doing the same. So much history, especially in the castle. Lots of volunteers who are more than happy to inform and answer questions. You can also buy vegetables and plants from the store when they are in season. There's a lovely cafe too if you want to stop for a coffee and cake."
Walmer Castle and Gardens,Birgitte L. (Bee),5,"What a magnificent place to be. The volunteers and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend doing the garden tour as well. The views were surprisingly beautiful. We are members of the English Heritage, and this was the first time using our membership. We are for sure going to visit more places in this country. Before I forget, yes, we do think this place is entirely worth a visit. Many times, different seasons, for years to come 👍🏾🥰"
Walmer Castle and Gardens,Tatiana Delover,4,"Lovely place to visit. Part of British Heritage. Not crowded. We loved the kitchen garden. Nice location, as you can visit Deal Castle (6 min by car) or Dover Castle (about 15 min) afterward"
Kelburn Castle and Estate,M Lawson,5,"Went for a tour and cream tea. Completely worth the money. The weather helped as part of your is through the grounds and it was a beautiful day. Gorgeous gardens and grounds with lots to do. Castle tour was very interesting by very knowledgeable and passionate tour guide, Addison and lovely fresh cream tea at the end. Word of advice, there is a lot of walking and stairs so not great for infirm or elderly but Addison made time for my mum and didn't rush her. Appreciated it. Worth the money. Worth the visit"
Kelburn Castle and Estate,Carol Vaughan,5,"Gorgeous grounds, the walks around the castle are incredible 😍 especially the waterfall and walled garden. We did the tour and can highly recommend it! Our guide, Addison, was amazing, super friendly, knowledgeable and made it informative and enjoyable. Will definitely be back."
Kelburn Castle and Estate,Janos Turk,5,"It is a good place for a family day out. It is recommended to visit this place in dry weather as it is a bit muddy when raining. The parking fee is £5 which is fair enough. The coffee shop was closed at 5pm so we missed that, but maybe next time. I can recommend this place."
Kelburn Castle and Estate,lynn kay,4,"Great place for fresh air, lovely walks, interesting with castle, waterfall and trails. Good adventure playground. Reasonable cafe ."
Kelburn Castle and Estate,Paul K,5,"We had a fantastic day here. Spent most of the day walking around the fantastic grounds. Plenty to keep the kids entertained.  We bought our tickets via Wowcher for £25. Parking here cost us £5. The grounds are free to walk around, we paid for the Spring Quest.  Staff are very friendly. Recommended"
Neuschwanstein Castle,Michael Blok,5,"Amazing palace in an amazing location between plains, lakes and high mountains. It looks medieval but is modern. Worth any voyage to come experience it and its surroundings. Not that easy to get to but the climb/walk only adds to the luster of your visit. Reservations run out weeks in advance in summer so plan your visit well. The bridge is best but not for the faint-hearted. I only go up a bit to take the amazing pictures of the castle, mountains, plain and lake. We did not enjoy coming with a disabled person. We booked for a disabled person and an accompanying adult but: 1. You can't get to the front gate without climbing 2. You can't use the elevators in the castle unless you have a separate ticket for it, which I was not told about 3. The horse carriage stops running at 6pm even though we were told it would run until after our tour finished, so my mother had to hitch a ride back in an employee's car. If none had been available, she would have had to spend the night on the mountain somehow."
Neuschwanstein Castle,J Choung,3,"Small and cute inside of the castle. Views from the wooden bridge are much better than the close views. A half-hour queue is necessary for entry of the bridge. If you don't like climbing or heavy walking, just enjoy it far away."
Neuschwanstein Castle,J l,5,"We visited in the beginning of July 2023. Online tickets were all sold out on the day we were planning to visit. We wanted to avoid the crowd. And opted to go in the evening. It turned out to be the best decision. We were able to park at the parking lot number 4, which was the closest to the road to walk up to the castle. We went up with two children age 6 and 8. The walk up to the castle was about 18 minutes and from the castle to the Marie’s Bridge was approximately 8 minutes. (It took us longer, because we were having fun along the way) On the Marie’s Bridge, you will be able to view the entire castle. I’m not scared of heights, but the bridge is high over a valley and a waterfall. There were only a few people there taking photos. We saw beautiful sunset on the way down. It was free, beautiful hike, and no crowds. It was remarkable!"
Neuschwanstein Castle,Adventurous stories of the Redfields,5,Amazing castle and environment. Unfortunately we couldn’t go in as only guided tours are available and it’s fully booked. So book in advance! Hike is also very nice but bring good hiking shoes. It’s an easy hike but quite steep so heavy in the knees going down.
Neuschwanstein Castle,Shimon Levy,4,"A beautiful visit to the Neuschwanstein castle. Take the buss up to the castle from P4 but make sure the buy ticket online before your arrival, especially if you’re looking for the English tour. The castle is beautiful but the tour was rather short. The views from up the hill was truly amazing."
Bran Castle,Thea Lily,5,"It’s an amazing castle with stunning views, would definitely recommend a visit. We didn’t have to queue to get and and it wasn’t too busy when we went.  The walk around the castle was so pretty. The grounds around the castle were beautiful as well.  One thing to note is the small corridors and stairways."
Bran Castle,Zofia Smoleń,3,"Cool but extremely crowded. We got there before opening and it was already packed. They should lift the price and admit less people. Other than that - the chamber of torture was cool, hidden stairs as well, but the rest is like any other castle."
Bran Castle,Gina Barta,5,"The castle was amazing to visit, all the rooms and imagining how it used to be a long time ago, that was great. The interior courtyard with the fountain is also amazing. Exiting through the elevator outside is cool. There were A LOT of people though, it would have been more enjoyable if there were less people in order to enjoy the rooms more but still it was worth it. Long, long queue to enter"
Bran Castle,Jimmie Luthra,5,"Beautiful medieval castle with amazing view and history. Also known as Dracula's castle, it is a must visit place. Tickets are a bit expensive during summer but worth the price. Buses are easily available, food and drinks are also available inside the castle area and also outside. There's a market near the castle gates. You can buy souvenirs and other cool stuff from there."
Bran Castle,Dimitar Tanchev,3,"Very big waiting line! Also the experience of someone rushing you to get on with the other halls/floors of the museum is quite annoying. It was too crowded inside the museum to have pleasant experience. Big advantage is the big parking lots near the castle. Overall the experience is something ""in the middle"""
Tintagel Castle,colin jarrett,5,"22 degrees and sunny. Too hot, some might say! It is a magical place for those who still believe. £54 entrance fee for 2 adults and a 17 year old. I would say was a little on the high side. Wonderful sights and so picturesque. I would highly recommend.  Beware - if you have mobility issues there is a service running you to the bottom and then back up. It's about half a mile walk and very steep in places.  Just enjoy the scenery it's just amazing"
Tintagel Castle,Becky,5,"Always wanted to come here and so glad I did! The walk up to the castle had some stunning views, but once you got up to the top and walked across the bridge the views became breathtaking. I was lucky to go on a sunny day and you could see for miles."
Tintagel Castle,Аня Таран,5,"Popular place. We went here with our children. But the island was closed due to rain and strong wind, keep that in mind when planning your trip. We waited for a couple of hours with the hope that the remains would be discovered. After lunch, it happened. A very beautiful place, the children had a map and it was interesting for them to follow it and explore the island. A large area, there is a place to spend the day. Steep descent and ascent to the village, but for a couple of pounds you can take a car that will take you to the island and back. If you are driving, there is a large parking. There are also many cafes where you can have lunch."
Tintagel Castle,Sara B.R.,4,"The views are absolutely gorgeous and we had an amazing sunny day that made the experience even better however it is a bit pricey... Also, if you are going with trolleys or have reduced mobility be wary, it is not easy access and if the toilets are needed you need to get completely down the stairs. Other than that, just plan for good shoes and enjoy!"
Tintagel Castle,Robert Stephenson,4,"Exhilarating views and walks. So much history. The staff continued to maintain safety and answered questions with a friendly rapport.  The walk can be strenuous if you're not prepared. Please review the website. They provide a Range Rover ride back up the hill, which is a welcome sight after the tours through the trails."
Čachtice Castle,Dave Harper,4,Great place. this is a very nice castle. you can park on the main square in the village or park on one of the upper parking spots which are paid but there is a small train-like car going regularly from the village to the top. the walk is nice in the forest and it is nothing difficult also manageable with kids. at the castle you have toilets. you have to pay entry fee but it is small amount and you can pay by card and have lovely talk with the lady selling them. from top there are beautiful views on the surrounding nature. inside there is also a souvenir store where again you can pay by card. highly recommend.
Čachtice Castle,Laura Wittchen,5,"Beautiful views. I hadn't anticipated the long trek up from the parking lot. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, have plenty of sunscreen, and water."
Čachtice Castle,Peter Adamove,5,"Recommended! Adult entrance ticket is currently 4.50€, it's possible to pay by card/cash. There is a small exhibition about the former owners and about the legend around Elisabeth Bathory's life and death. The  castle itself is in ruins with some parts of the upper palace being currently repaired. Views are quite stunning."
Čachtice Castle,MYTRIPLINE,5,"Trip from Slovakia to Czech Republic with MYTRIPLINE.  Čachtice Castle is a castle ruin in Slovakia next to the village of Čachtice. It stands on a hill featuring rare plants, and has been declared a national nature reserve for this reason. The castle was a residence and later the prison of the Countess and alleged serial killer Elizabeth Báthory.  Čachtice was built in the mid-13th century by Kazimir from the Hont-Pázmány gens as a sentry on the road to Moravia. Later, it belonged to Matthew Csák, the Stibor family, and then to Elizabeth Báthory. Čachtice, its surrounding lands and villages, was a wedding gift from the Nádasdy family upon Elizabeth's marriage to Ferenc Nádasdy in 1575.  Originally, Čachtice was a Romanesque castle with an interesting horseshoe-shaped residence tower. It was turned into a Gothic castle later and its size was increased in the 15th and 16th centuries. A Renaissance renovation followed in the 17th century. In 1708 the castle was captured by the rebels of Francis II Rákóczi. It was neglected and burned down in 1799. It was left to decay until it was turned into a tourist attraction in 2014.  MYTRIPLINE Team"
Čachtice Castle,Vaclav J.,5,Nice place with great history…. good people and very nice services
Annevoie Castle,Tasha Live,5,"Absolutely beautiful place! We were at a special event. Costumes of Venice! It was amazing, if not to count large amounts of people:))"
Annevoie Castle,Laurențiu Florean,4,"Nice gardens. A bit overpriced. If you get the chance, it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here."
Annevoie Castle,Geza Mark,5,"We go there nearly every year. It's a lovely, peaceful and well kept garden, between Namur and Dinanat. It's amazing that the fountains work only with the energy of gravity, without any machinery. There is a large and free parking place there."
Annevoie Castle,Szabina Baros,5,"Beautiful huge garden to visit cca 80 km from Brussels. Nice buffet, good souvenir shop, large free parking, benches to sit down during walking. Even on Saturday, tge whole place is not crowded. The whole neighbourhood is pretty, full of hidden gems to visit all around in the villages nearby."
Annevoie Castle,J. Alejandro Martinez U.,4,A beautiful garden. Peaceful and fresh. Well kept and easy to walk.
Château de Villandry,Mauro C,5,The garden of this castle are breathtaking. The garden visit is worth the ticket cost. This concept of garden mix of flowers and vegetable is really great. This castle that was confiscated during the French Revolution was then acquired by Emperor Napoleon for his brother. In 1906 was acquired by Carvallo family thus is still owning it. Since the beginning the family invested lot of money to create and maintain these amazing gardens.
Château de Villandry,Kath Ch,5,"The most amazing gardens I've ever seen. For that alone it's worth to come here and see it. Wonderful park surrounding the castle, convenient location and a huge free parking. Villandry is definitely a good experience."
Château de Villandry,William Frankson,5,"An incredible place to visit. The best chateau in the area. We visited both the house and gardens. In the house there was plenty to see and learn, with good information on the leaflets you are given about each room and it's history. But the gardens are the real gem here. They are amazing. Lots of different gardens to see and explore so plenty to do. The surrounding area is stunning too. Really easy to find, free parking as well and a very reasonable price for entry."
Château de Villandry,53 mph,5,"Easily the most beautiful gardens in the Loire Valley. Everywhere you look is harmoniously composed and meticulously upkept. Every time you think you've seen it all, there is another level to discover. The interior of the chateau is also interesting with stunning views of the gardens from the towers.  Car park is free and close to the chateau. Dogs are allowed in the grounds but must be carried in a bag inside the castle (so small dogs only).  The cafe is just outside the castle ground. You can exit the castle and re-enter without difficulty. Be warned though, around 1-2pm it becomes insanely busy. I would advise taking a picnic."
Château de Villandry,Sonia Ennals,5,"So many Chateaux open to the public, but this is one not to miss.  The gardens are incredible and the care and upkeep of the grounds just fab.  There are amazing geometric patterns in the hedging, peaceful lakes with fountains, kitchen gardens, a maze for the kids, and great explanations of how they conserve water and keep this amazing garden in pristine condition."
Château de Cazeneuve,Rory Davidson,5,Beautifully restored chateau with tour guides who are very friendly and know their stuff. Excellent accessible facilities and beautiful grounds. A hidden gem worth visiting.
Château de Cazeneuve,Luc016,4,"Pretty nice castle with a very big garden. Don't forget to come when the weather is nice, it's much better! To visit the interior, it has to be a guided visit so there is not the possibility to freely visit it. It is prohibited to take pictures inside which is why I am putting 4 stars. Not a very big castle but it's still something fairly nice."
Château de Cazeneuve,retired_of_yorkshire,5,A very good tour introduced by the current owner who obviously works very hard. A good tasting after the look around the Castle and the gift shop was full of lovely goods to buy.
Château de Cazeneuve,Jane Hem,4,Very interesting and met the owner
Château de Cazeneuve,Anthony Munns,4,Well-preserved Chateau still family owned with signifance to both French and British royal succession through Eleanor of Aquitaine. Working wine production of Sauterne wine. The tour ends with a tasting and the opportunity to buy this delicious dessert wine at reasonable prices.
Château des ducs de Bretagne,Marcel Narita,5,"Great view inside and also outside from the 500m round walk on the wall. The museum is also worth visiting with a huge collection of exhibits. Top attraction of Nantes, don’t miss it!"
Château des ducs de Bretagne,Nhat Minh,5,"It was the weekend of march 2023, the sky was lovely. I booked the ticket day for student, so the price for visiting the monument is so cheap. You should change the ticket before come inside the Castle of Ducs. It so big and large, we spent about 2,5 hours to all exploring. There is a map in the reception and the locking to put the bag and the coats 🧥. You can read the history of Nantes and also watch the short video in the museum. Outside the castle 🏰, there is the place to see the city center. Near by the Gare center. Highly recommended for your trip in Nantes."
Château des ducs de Bretagne,Jamal Omar,5,"The design of the castle looks very unique, and although I didn't spend much time in it, yet I noticed and liked few stuff. I liked that it's surrounded by water where ducks swim and play around, which is a nice scenery, and moreover the grass down there is very beautiful where people sit and enjoy their time, quite unique. I recommend any group of people passing by to go there and spend some time around it."
Château des ducs de Bretagne,Paula B.,5,It is free and everyone can visit. Within city centre and lots of shops and restos nearby. saw people brought their dogs and kids to have mini picnic around the area.
Château des ducs de Bretagne,Sharon Murphy,5,Woman in gift shop very knowledgeable about history of art exhibitions. Free entry but pay for art exhibitions
Vaduz Castle,Eduardo Arino de la Rubia,4,"I would love to give this 5 stars, however... the castle has been the primary residence of Liechtenstein's Princely Family. The castle is not open to the public as the princely family still lives in the castle. I simply can not give 5 stars to a castle, I can't experience, so 4 stars it is. I hope the House of Liechtenstein does not take this personally.  However, the views are really quite beautiful, there are really nice walking trails nearby, and the castle parking was quite convenient."
Vaduz Castle,Lori B,3,"Like everyone previously said, you can not go inside (the royal family still lives here) so if you choose to go to the top there is a beautiful view to take photos . A good ten minutes should suffice."
Vaduz Castle,Radhika De Silva,3,"Not much you can see to be honest. It's not accessible to the public. Other than making the grumpy security guy anxious , there isn't much to do. Haha. But you do get some nice views of the city below if you decide to walk up there. The castle is being renovated these days, so it's really not worth the visit."
Vaduz Castle,Tomas Benes,5,"Vaduz castle is under reconstruction, but even before is not public. So, few views on the Vaduz, castle and Lichtenstein beautiful countryside from above. Not over castle, drone restrictions applies in surrounding of castle and government areas."
Vaduz Castle,Adrian Machado,4,"There is quite a bit of hiking involved to get to this castle. Luckily , there are many informational placards places along the way for you to read while resting on the benches. The hike is most of the fun as you can’t enter the castle under normal circumstances. Worth going on a warm day for a nice view."
Het Oude Loo,Someya Parvin,4,"Nice place for half day visit..Big garden to walk around and have a calm, peaceful time with friends and family."
Het Oude Loo,Alexandra Walker,5,This place was so neat and it's only open for such a short period of time. I highly suggest you check it out.
Het Oude Loo,Rachel Dagan,5,"A beautiful palace. It is recommended to download the app and walk through the palace rooms with detailed and interesting explanations. It is also recommended to go up to the roof of the palace, hear an explanation from the guide there and enjoy the view of the gardens."
Het Oude Loo,Tomáš Matyáštík,5,Beautiful complex. To fully enjoy you need 4 hours :-)
Het Oude Loo,Simeon Iliev,5,Great place to have a walk and relax. Beatiful castle surrounded by a lake. Nice park and gardens.
Hotel Zamek Bobolice,Artur,5,Really enjoyed my stay here. Everything is well organized and clean. Well created with  a pleasing esthetic. Great value as well. I came by bicycle and the had a secure storage space. My only gripe is the weak internet - it was unusable.
Hotel Zamek Bobolice,Caros Bücher,2,"The location and view is great, one can see the castle from the rooms, but the service lacks quality: During dinner we got the main dish before the starter and being only 2 guests and no big group I expected that our food would be timed, so we can eat at the same time and I was disappointed that this wasn't the case. The rooms were fine but again small things like an empty box of tissues in the bathroom and a broken trash bin. As the hotel is quite pricey such things shouldn't happen."
Hotel Zamek Bobolice,Władysław Hoffmann,5,"Very nice place. Great hotel, castle reconstructed from ruina in great style."
Hotel Zamek Bobolice,Barbara H,5,Wooow😍
Hotel Zamek Bobolice,Tomasz Cebulski,5,Super
Waterschap Brabantse Delta,JP Blankert,1,"Water board charges are rising to such an extent that citizens are drowning in them. I called why the charges were so high in 2023. On the phone I was told: 'Because energy prices have risen so much'. That is stupid purchasing, the daily prices for energy were only high for a very short time, Frank Energie should have been chosen with the daily actual energy prices instead of tariffs at an energy giant that is stretching the pretext of the Ukraine war over as long as possible."
Waterschap Brabantse Delta,Jmer A,1,"Nice review about beautiful gardens, but it is of course about the water level in the region and that task has not been properly fulfilled every year, capital damage because the water board does not have good control of the water level. The water board calls this a headache at the same time, they claim to do the job well (?) When they call, there is no answer to the questions, only rude behavior by laughing at you. YES REALLY TRUE while we sit here with wet feet, damage, worrying and asking questions we are just laughed at and eventually the telephone connection is disconnected by these disrespectful officials."
Waterschap Brabantse Delta,Ƴoƙą 28,4,"No opinion about this company. Only walked through it to get to the destination, namely the beautiful garden of Bouvigne Castle."
Waterschap Brabantse Delta,Anders Stålberg,4,Beautiful garden around the castle. Calm and nice environment.
Waterschap Brabantse Delta,Floris Yeetus,5,Good chicks and minecraft GFs can be found here
Archiwum Państwowe w Katowicach Oddział w Pszc...,Roger Lustig,5,Found everything I was looking for and more. Staff knew their stuff and were glad to help.
Wawel Royal Castle,Allan MacIver,5,This castle is a bit special you need time and some patience to visit. I still cannot believe that entrance to the grounds and garden is free. There is so much to see and enjoy and there is such a buzz about the place. We did not visit the interior of the castle as there was a very long queue. I think you will enjoy the castle and grounds without seeing inside.  We had a lovely day and we visited one of the cafes which was great. If you must visit inside you would be advised to book in advance.
Wawel Royal Castle,Evelina Koch,5,"Must see when in Krakow! The most beautiful castle in Poland! It was a place of great Polish kings, survived many wars and battles. Views are just amazing! Must go!"
Wawel Royal Castle,KJK Ravi Teja,4,"The entrance itself gives you touristic, popular vibes. All the places are unique in their own way because of different historical backgrounds, and so is this place too. One thing we didn't like is the fact that we have to buy separate tickets for each place in the same compound. They can give an option to buy a combined ticket to visit all 6-7 places inside this compound."
Wawel Royal Castle,Chris Lam,5,"Came here on a Tuesday and there was a huge line to buy tickets so I would suggest you purchase tickets in advance. As far as the exhibitions I only went to the state rooms which were mildly interesting. I’m not sure I would pay to see anything next time, it’s better to just walk around the castle and learn the history on your own. The cathedral also looked stunning though I did not pay to go inside. To be honest everything seemed like a cash grab."
Wawel Royal Castle,Abhinav Sharma,5,1. Must visit Place. 2. The best city view especially for sunset. 3. The eco-greenery over the walls is mesmerizing. 4. Peaceful place and free arms chairs are available to sit. 5. The localities are very friendly towards foreigners. 6. Romantic place for couples for hand-in-hand walks.
Dolmabahçe Palace,Adel Alawiyat,4,Great place to visit to learn about the later part of 660+ years of Ottoman history. Try to buy the tickets online to avoid the ticket line. You need to be patient with the crowd. Try to come early in the morning to avoid the rush. You’ll need between 2-3 hours to go through the palace and the painting museum. Taking photos is not allowed inside the buildings.
Dolmabahçe Palace,Enes Karaca,5,This palace is gigantic! beautiful architecture!  The garden is very big and so awesome. You have to visit this place. And please go inside too! The inside of this palace is more beautiful!!
Dolmabahçe Palace,Y S P M,3,"To see a Luxurious and beautiful palace then pay 650TL , otherwise stay out side and take pictures, spend the money in useful way. If you enter into the palace then take your own time and see many interesting exhibits about Sultan life and Ottoman Empire. Photography Restricted inside the palace."
Dolmabahçe Palace,Natasha Venizelos,3,"I enjoyed my time visiting this palace. It had a fantastic audio guide included that actually worked! The external grounds are well-maintained and are pretty spectacular. The inside of the building is also very grand. It is a real shame you can’t take pictures, though.  Logistical note: Closed on Mondays. Long ticket line wait times. Extensive premises, leave enough time to cover everything, at least 2 hours inside."
Dolmabahçe Palace,Ajay Gaikwad,4,"The Palace is very beautiful with rich history. If you are interested in knowing all the details , an audio tour is recommended. The palace is huge and takes around 2-3 hours to explore. Photos/videos are not allowed  inside the palace. The entrance fees may differ as we heard  all attractions tickets are getting spiked up. We visited on Aug 18th and paid 650 TRY per person."
Miramare Castle,Sumeet Sinha,5,Very beautiful castle with a garden around it. It can reached via car or even by a hop on hop off bus tour (you have to walk 700m along the sea to reach if you take the hop on hop off bus option). The approach road is narrow so reaching by car can be challenging if you’re not used to drive on narrow tight roads.
Miramare Castle,Jennifer Murphy,5,Such a beautiful place to visit. We took a taxi and they drop you off down aways from the castle so be prepared to walk. The grounds and gardens are gorgeous with beautiful views all around.
Miramare Castle,Alexandra Pinte,5,"Absolutely stunning! The park itself as you walk to the Castle is gorgeous, the gardens surrounding it are just beautiful and the Castle itself is simply stunning! Amazing architecture and just gorgeously inspiring! ❤️ would definitely love to go back and spend at least a day there!"
Miramare Castle,Dženi Batagelj,5,"Beautiful scenery. Amazing vistas. Both the castle and the surrounding landscape are magnificent. Parking can be a little challenging, but it's worth it. I absolutely recommend it."
Miramare Castle,Alex Lajtos,5,"Stunning castle and gorgeous scenery. I’d recommend visiting early in the morning when they open to have more peace in the Castle garden and at the bay. Waters along the castle are crystal clear and full of fish, many people were snorkelling or scuba diving close to the shore next to the castle. Parking is tricky so again the earlier you arrive the better options you have"
Parador de Olite,Winnie Coleman,5,Wonderful historic inn with lots to see nearby. Service was wonderful and meals were extraordinary. Loved just sitting in the little cafés and watching people go by outside.
Parador de Olite,Graham Ramsey,5,"Quiet but beautiful place. Little going on but early in the season. Motorcycle parking at the rear, moderately secure. All good. Loved it"
Parador de Olite,Emma Baker,3,"Very nice hotel in a nice location, located in a beautiful castle. The beds were comfortable and bathroom spacious. However, it was very cold in the room at night. Also the breakfast was quite expensive, €24 per person."
Parador de Olite,Giovanni Balzi,5,"Hotel placed in a perfect location in the town center of Olite, couple of steps form the Castle and the church, in one of the main square. The hotel from the outside look like a medieval palace, from the inside even if a little more modernized still maintains medieval vibe. Staff was helpful but doesn't speak very good english. There is a restaurant inside which is really good, and probably the best place to eat in Olite. Rooms where cleans and bath was well furnished."
Parador de Olite,Cathy Yang,5,"We enjoyed our stay at the parador de olite very much! The parador itself is such a unique building filled with history, and to be able to live in it is like walking into a history book. The location is quiet and all amenities are extremely clean, comfortable and well thought of. We'll definitely stay here again."
Herrenchiemsee New Palace,david antoun,5,"Impressive Building, surrounded by vast green areas, protected animal forests, royal fountains and a very engineered view to the chiemseelake. the tour is always guided with an employee, photos are not allowed, you will buy the 10€ ticket at the beginning of the Island and you have 20 min walking to reach the entrance gate divided according to groups and languages. the Employees are very friendly, professional and well informed about the History. buy the guidance book from the shop before the Tour started, then you can follow with pictures all the way along (3€). payment cash at the shop, caffe with Terrasse at the entrance, closets and clean baths."
Herrenchiemsee New Palace,Boris Maric,5,"Boat return ticket to the island is 10€ per person or 27€ for the family of four. Additionally, the castle ticket which you can buy on the island is 10€ per person for a guided tour. It was all worth it as the place and the surroundings are incredible. There is a café and a restaurant inside the castle to have a break after the tour."
Herrenchiemsee New Palace,Liz Kitura,5,"A breathtaking incomplete palace constructed by Ludwig the second in the middle of a scenic lake. I highly recommend paying the 3€ for the carriage ride from the ferry, it really added to the whole experience of arriving at the gardens"
Herrenchiemsee New Palace,Maryam Klidsar,5,"Unfortunately, you can't take photos from inside the castle. The castle was the last building project of the king of Bavaria in the late 19th century. It was an homage to King Louis the 14th of France, as he highly respected him. There are paintings of the sun king (Louis the 14th), paintings referenced to French historical events, French objects, and similarities to Versailles palace like the Hall of Mirrors. There is a monastery on the island ( the biggest island in Chiemsee among the 3, and it was bought by King Ludwig the Second) where the king stayed there at the times when he visited to inspect the construction of the palace. The palace was never finished and the majority of the rooms are unfinished,  with a few of them done in the most lavish and exquisite style, leaving the visitors in awe. The visit is guided and the ticket to the palace which includes the visit to the monastery and the museum is also included and is 10 €. It can be bought at the entrance of the island once you get off the boat. PS. There is also a carriage ride around the island to the castle in summertime A must-visit if you visit Chiemsee."
Herrenchiemsee New Palace,RAMPRASAD SRINIVASAN,5,"Awesome palace, guided tour of palace available for € 10 in Deutsche and English. Tour lasts about 40 minutes.  From the ticket counters it takes good 15-20 minutes walk to reach the palace and horse carriage service is also available for € 3.5 to reach palace, from Ticket counter.  Over all a good experience."
Royal Palace of Aranjuez,Sabrina Fenn,4,"Really nice place with beautiful gardens. Shame the fountains are not always on, especially on the warmest of days. I have attached a photo which shows which people get concessions, otherwise it's €9 to enter the actual building. We arrived a little late to do so, although I have been before many years ago. We did do a walk around the gardens and enjoyed the scent of the roses and seeing the little birds in the aviary. Bear in mind, in the summer it is very hot and often little in the way of shaded areas in some parts of the grounds, however under the trees its a few degrees cooler and rather pleasant. Really worth the visit, very historical and quite romantic. The walks alongside the river are also very nice and I did see some people enjoying jumping from the bridge into the river and also other swimming. I'm not sure how safe that is however so I would ask locals before doing so. There is also a boat trip along the river where you can also see the sights, but best to book as it was already fully booked the day we went."
Royal Palace of Aranjuez,Georges Younes,5,"The Royal Palace of Aranjuez is situated not too far from Madrid, an easy train ride away. Just head to the Cercanias station in Atocha early in the morning and get a round-trip ticket. There are several trains in each direction every day. Aranjuez can be done in a single day, assuming that you start early. You can visit the palace, then the gardens. There are also several choices for lunch in town. They're a little pricier than many places in Madrid because they cater mostly to tourists. They're still affordable. The Royal Palace is mostly about architectural perspectives. So your enjoyment will improve if you take a long walk around it. The rooms of the palace are richly decorated, but won't add much to your experience if you've visited similar palaces in Spain. Focus on the gardens which are inspiring, even if they need to be maintained better."
Royal Palace of Aranjuez,Darusik1,5,Nice place to visit over the weekend just make sure to book restaurant before going. Chances to find anything without reservation is close to zero. Beautiful parks and a little train to go around the town with a bit of insight about it.
Royal Palace of Aranjuez,Stephen Law,4,No need to book for an unguided tour. Arrive and head for unguided tour line. You need id -  passport or id card. Your bag will be scanned. Take a tablet guide and ear piece. €5 well spent. Palace is smaller scale Palacio Real in Madrid. A good morning well spent
Royal Palace of Aranjuez,david howells,4,Imposing palace but it didn’t quite do it for me. The gardens are great and it oozes opulence but there are only a few rooms (about 12) and they charge €9 for entry so I didn’t go in. The gardens are beautiful and the architecture is great but not quite up there with some of the palaces of Europe.
Château de Sully-sur-Loire,charles robinson,5,"Not restored to boutique standards, but with more than enough history and artifacts to occupy a morning or a leisurely day. Not nearly as crowded as others."
Château de Sully-sur-Loire,Tanis Silbernagel,5,"Cute little moated Château with a quick 45 minute circuit. They had English description placards in all the rooms, free parking, and nice facilities. I enjoyed it much more than some of the bigger castles in the area."
Château de Sully-sur-Loire,Carlos Orue,5,"Spectacular don't even need to enter, just take a walk around the surroundings.  Park your car free metres from the palace."
Château de Sully-sur-Loire,Werner de Rijcke,4,"Beautiful castle. Restaured well. Wood of the roof repaired too, in good condition. Nice to walk around in the different chambers. Entrance price is 8 Euro per person. Price worth, we can advise this trip."
Château de Sully-sur-Loire,Chrissi H,5,Another beautiful castle along the Loire. With beautiful woods and possibilities to go for walks and have a picnic.
Royal Palace of La Granja of San Ildefonso,A Colaco,5,Must visit site just outside of Segovia. Took about 50 minutes to drive from Madrid; parking was very easy (on a weekday in mid-April). We were amazed with the property — and the audio tour which we purchased with our tickets was so informative. Allow about 2 hours to tour the palace and the grounds. Would definitely recommend reading about the family prior to our visit so you can appreciate the history and use of the home!
Royal Palace of La Granja of San Ildefonso,Geoffrey Berg,5,"The tapestry collection from Carlos V and the gardens were the highlight for me, I've never seen such beautiful and well preserved tapestries (so not surprisingly you can't take pictures).  The palace is beautiful although much of it was rebuilt after a fire and so for that reaso the building itself is not as beautiful or impactful as El Escorial, but for the gardens and tapestries alone this is worth a visit."
Royal Palace of La Granja of San Ildefonso,Vienna,3,"Admission to the garden is free but the museum entrance fee is 9 euros, which is far worse than Versailles. The most ridiculous thing is that you can take photos in Versailles, but this replica is not allowed to be photographed inside and the staff is not so friendly."
Royal Palace of La Granja of San Ildefonso,Duncan Parsons,5,An impressive palace though not much of the building accessible to visitors. What is available is worth seeing. Particularly the tapestries and a magnificent dining room. Ceilings wonderfully painted. The gardens are actually more interesting and with some wonderful statues. Well worth a visit.
Royal Palace of La Granja of San Ildefonso,Lisa Derbyshire,5,"Incredible! Spent several hours wandering the labyrinth of walkways lined with autumnal coloured hedgerows and trees. At so many turns spectacular fountains were mesmerising, even if not on. A wondrous place and personally I think it’s an insult to call it the French Versailles, even if it is of French design. All credit to the Spanish for keeping it as stunning as it is."
Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,Saswat Sasmal,5,"Beautiful, and a must visit part of Ukraine. The city near this castle is also a pleasant city, small and happening."
Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,Dmytro Buldakov,4,"The place is well refurbished and has a lot of touristic attractions, however they kinda disregarded the authenticity.  Nevertheless it’s still serves well as an sort of amusement park.  Good for kind, and families. Have some quick bites options and small shops, workshops, and museums."
Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,Ohad Alon,4,"A very picturesk town, that parts of 8t feel like they remained 7nchanged since the 16 hundreds.  And the fortress is a must place to visit."
Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,Santiago Andrigo,5,"Beautiful castle. There isn't so much to see inside but there is a nice technology interactive museum, a archery game, souvenir places, and eating establishments."
Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,neşe arikan,2,Such a big disappointment. It was looking beautiful from outside yet inside was not maintained well. I am sure department of tourism could have done a better job on the construction & decoration of inside so people can enjoy this beautiful castle more.
Marksburg,Cheryl Gramp,5,Very interesting stop on our tour. My son enjoyed the displays of armor and weapons through the ages. I loved the view of the Rhine.
Marksburg,Öht,5,"Very nice castle with nice tour. Tour takes roughly one hour and is also very nice for the children. The way from the parking ground (with comes 3€) is very easy to walk and takes only a few minutes. The hiking trails from down town look very nice - I guess, it’s not heavy to reach the castle by walk from the city center. Did not try, because it was heavy raining, but I would have liked to."
Marksburg,Svitlana Shkriabina,4,"We walked from the railway station up to the castle near 20 minutes. If you go by a car, the parking is not far from the castle. But nevertheless you must have sports shoes to walk inside,  because of the rocky roads. The entrance fee for adults is 11 euro. At 13.00 is the gide tour in English. There is also a cafe where you can wait for the tour starting. The castle is open every day (at least at the summertime)."
Marksburg,David Edwards,5,It was really nice. The staff were very kind and also spoke English. There were guided tours in English and German. The food was surprisingly good. The marks burger was really delicious!
Marksburg,Chris Hickman,5,This wasn't an easy walk but so well worth the effort. The guides are very passionate about the history and preservation of this landmark. They provide a great insight and context around the lives of the inhabitants through the centuries.
Eltz Castle,Joseph Buckles,4,It's a beautiful drive up to the castle. Car park was €8. While you can take a bus for €4/pp each way the walk along the trail is very easy and makes the reveal all the better. It's a pretty castle with a lot of history. But it isn't exciting. The tour was bland and rushed. No real time to really enjoy and appreciate it. I'd like to suggest that maybe they get period dressed guides in the rooms to tell stories. The cafe is reasonably priced. The food was also tasty. I'd like to have spent more time hiking around. That will be a return trip.
Eltz Castle,Phillip Soto,5,"One of my favorite castles in Germany and well worth the visit. The parking is €4 and the entrance is €14 and a tour is included (German and English offered). From the parking area, you can take a bus to the entrance or simply walk/hike there. The hike wasn't bad at all and I feel is part of the overall experience. The castle itself is very well preserved and maintained."
Eltz Castle,Srinivasan Gopalan,5,"Must visit place. Nice castle and museum. Castle located on top of a mountain with a lot of greenery is great for some nice photos. A River flowing by is easily accessible. Also a nice place for trekking for beginners. Will be nice for a day trip. For those who cannot walk to the castle through the trekking trail, you can take the shuttle bus from the parking lot."
Eltz Castle,Hashim Fakhreddin,5,"Beautiful historical castle, amazing views and landscape.  We really enjoyed our English guided tour that was part of our ticket. The tour was really insightful and interesting.  If you're able to hike, would recommend walking down to the castle, see how you go, then at the bottom decide whether you can hike up or take the shuttle for €2  Entrance to the castle was €14, which is alright considering it comes with a guided tour.  Also the souvenir shop was amazing, lots of great items for great price"
Eltz Castle,Azian Shariff,5,"Shuttle bus costs 2€ per person/trip. Those with strong knees should walk down the road to the castle. The entrance ticket comes with a guided tour. The English-speaking guide, from my perspective, is pretty boring. Otherwise, the castle itself is really impressive."
Hrad Devín,Pooja Bhat,5,"Just beautiful!!! Serene experience.  We were on a short visit to Bratislava and we are glad to have explored this place. Taking the early morning bus to this place, the journey itself began beautifully and the place was just beyond beautiful. Nature at its best. The views of the villages, fields, river (where you can see border with Austria), forests, and the castle. It was amazing. The fresh air, clean water, greens everywhere.. filled my heart and soul with peace. Definitely a must visit place if you are planning to go to Bratislava. The premise has washroom facility, drinking water and lots of benches to rest. It's kids friendly too. Overall a great experience being here."
Hrad Devín,Anthony Chan,5,Really great castle. One of the best sights from the Bratislava card. Best views of the river danube. Lots of interactive activities including archery and armour wearing. A bit far from the city but well worth the travel. Can spend half a day here
Hrad Devín,Rich Bell,4,"It's a nice tourist site. Not as busy as the main sites in Bratislava, but also not as pretty/large as the castle or main downtown of Bratislava. On the weekend there were crowds, but not so much that it ruined the experience. Parking was available and appeared to be no cost (we biked in, so didn't park). Lots of restaurants and wine vendors. Restaurant prices ranged from typical for the area or a little less expensive."
Hrad Devín,Piuli Basu Roy Chowdhury,5,"A piece of history from the early Slovakian era. The castle is standing on a cliff on Danube Bank, with Danube flowing underneath the castle. The view from the place is simply breathtaking. We spent a lot of time here appreciating the beauty and the exhibition they presented. This is a must visit while in Bratislava."
Hrad Devín,Valia Mokiou,5,"Very interesting place to visit  15 minutes from Bratislava, with car-bolt (which is very cheap means of transport). Great views to Danube and Morava. They accept only card for the admission."
Peel Castle,Dr Wat,5,"The whole experience for me was summed up by the enthusiastic greeting by the guide, could not be more pleasant or welcoming. Great audio tour, each section was only a minute long with a very fetching accent and music. Grounds were well looked after.  Well worth a look"
Peel Castle,John Callaghan,5,Really enjoyed visiting the castle. Staff super friendly and helpful on entry. Make sure you take national trust card or similar/equivalent membership as it might get you free entry. Beautiful location and amazing views of Peel and the coastline.
Peel Castle,Angus Carpenter,4,"A really nicely positioned castle, which can normally enter to look around (but wasn't when we went on 10th April 2023 for an unknown reason).  However, despite this you can completely walk around the outside following the wall around the rocky outcrop, which gives some cracking views. It's also worth walking along the harbour wall too, keep an eye out for some large barrel jellyfish, seals and a host of coastal birds. Take a walk up the nearby mount too that gives you a lovely view of the castle too. If it's a nice day, take your swimwear and go for a dip in the sea from the lovely sandy & sheltered cove.  You can park your car on the quayside road, which is easy to find."
Peel Castle,Joy Tear,5,The 7 acre grounds of this castle brought me to tears. The power and beauty of this place moved me in a way nothing ever has before. Plan to spend 2 hours here if you want to learn as much as possible. They will give you a handheld device that provides information. Each stop around the grounds has a corresponding dialogue and I recommend doing each and every one (around 35 if I remember correctly). We spent so much time here the battery died on ours so we had to get another to finish the last few items. The views of and from the castle are breath taking. I have photos but they do not compare to going in person. If you're in Isle of Man and you do nothing else this is the one thing you HAVE to make time to do.
Peel Castle,Michael O'Keeffe,5,"Apart from the rain, this castle was one of the best I've been to. Such interesting history and story. You can feel the atmosphere throughout. Superb."
State Castle Bezděz,Randy Law,5,There are Parking Lots P1 and P2. P2 is closer. 10Kz for parking. Separate fee to explore inside of Castle walls. The view from the Tower is amazing and 360.
State Castle Bezděz,Jan Pochobradský,4,"to be honest, I was kinda dissapointed🤷🏼‍♂️so I’ll start with negatives:  - Parking quite far (as long as you are not one of the very first at the higher Parking lot). Especially with toddlers.🅿️ - At the top wasn’t anything spectacular to see (I would have expected so shows or exhibitions)🤷🏼‍♂️  Positives:  - the Castle looks nice from far away😂 - enough bistros on the way up🍺 - Adventurous Road up😅  I’ve just visited a lot of castles, ruins,…so I might be a bit too critical. If there was something cool up there, I’d consider to visit again. But the kids had fun anyway😇  I’d give it 3,5⭐️"
State Castle Bezděz,Karel Chromý,4,"Bezdez Castle is a captivating historical gem nestled amidst picturesque landscapes. Its imposing architecture and rich history offer a captivating journey into the past. The guided tour was informative, providing insights into the castle's significance. The panoramic views from the tower are breathtaking, making the climb worthwhile. However, limited amenities and accessibility could be improved. Overall, Bezdez Castle is a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts and adventurers seeking a glimpse into medieval times."
State Castle Bezděz,Len Tierra,5,We visited this castle with my family in autumn. The morning fog created enchanted atmosphere. It has real halloween feeling of haunted gothic castle  from 12th century. The guide was super helpful and answered all questions from my curious mommy. The price for the tickets was reasonable.
State Castle Bezděz,Kath Ch,5,"Fantastic castle towering above all else in the area. There is nice small hike to get there, but the views are quite amazing. 100 CZK for parking, 150 for a ticket for an adult (you can pay by card) Absolutely worth it. The ruins are magical, there is plenty to see, I recommend doing the tower for the views. The castle is located about 1 hour from Prague, which makes it a nice one day trip."
Kasteel Borrekens,Survivor's Journey,5,So beautiful and relaxing
Kasteel Borrekens,yannick1989127,5,Very beautiful 😍 path in the woods with a nice view on the castle 🏰. There is water around the castle.
Kasteel Borrekens,NIVARANI BRAHMA,5,"Borrekens is a private owned castle in middle of the nature. We couldn't enter to the castle; however, there is relaxing walking place around the castle."
Kasteel Borrekens,Nima,4,"Imaginary, like castes in fairy tales! Had some difficulty to park the car, still don't know if there are parking spots foreseen or not."
Kasteel Borrekens,Martha Turnbull,4,"Very beautiful, but very hard to see. You cannot visit the castle as it is a private residence."
Turku Castle,Sina Ghazi,5,"If you want to learn about Finland history, this castle is where you should begin. It is a total representation of happenings during time and you get the chance to see the change since medival time. Highly recommended place!"
Turku Castle,Pink Mean,5,"Turku Castle is a must-visit for history enthusiasts and those intrigued by Finland's past. The medieval architecture and rich interior offer a captivating glimpse into history. Also, don't forget to explore the interesting souvenirs in the shop"
Turku Castle,Sang Tran Ngoc,4,"Must visit when you're in ancient capital Turku. Its stories and information tell you a lots of Finnish history and culture in the past. If you wanna discover all corners of the castle, current ticket is 14e. Highly recommended"
Turku Castle,Einat Schreibman Fainholtz,5,"A wonderful castle, which is a must for every visitor to Turku! A beautiful building that underwent a conservation process, and its spaces have become a living museum of extraordinary history. The museum includes dramatic exhibition spaces, and spaces with interactive displays for children who can be almost real knights🤺🤺, kings and queens👸🤴🏻 Throughout the year, there are unique activities, plays and workshops for children. A place that the children want to return to again and again...  The complex has a cafe with a unique atmosphere. Hot and sweet chocolate was an excellent end to a winter visit to the castle...☕☕"
Turku Castle,Mark Emerson Dela Cruz,5,"A must visit site if you are in Turku, Finland. Said to be one of the oldest medieval buildings still in use in Finland. The castle offers exhibition of artificats from different historical period. It is fascinating that Finland government is supportive in preserving historical places."
Muiderslot,Susana Magalhães,5,"Muiderslot Castle, situated in the captivating landscapes of Belgium, is undeniably one of the most exquisite places I've had the pleasure to visit. From the moment I laid eyes on its majestic turrets and picturesque moat, I was transported to a fairytale realm of bygone eras. The meticulous preservation of its historic architecture, combined with the surrounding lush gardens, creates an ambiance that is truly enchanting. Exploring the interior is like stepping back in time, with each room revealing intricate details and stories of the past. The panoramic views from the castle's towers offer a breathtaking panorama that captures the essence of Belgium's natural beauty. Muiderslot Castle has effortlessly etched itself into my memory as a truly unforgettable and mesmerizing destination."
Muiderslot,Shawn Taylor,5,There is a lot of history and a lot of walkable grounds to visit! There are stairs and can be steep for some individuals but highly recommend. When visiting this fort I recommend taking the full tour and visiting all the rooms. Helps to have a bit of imagination!
Muiderslot,Dawn Wood,5,"We went on a Monday,  so only the castle was open.  But it was perfect.  It's a bit of a walk from the bus. Seashell paved walkways.  Audio tours are free. Lots of narrow stairs. Lots of history,  well laid out."
Muiderslot,Clara Ruiz,5,Castle location is beautiful. Came here by bike on a sunny day and the journey was lovely. You can visit inside + towers. Audioguide available for free with your ticket and entrance for free with museum card. You can also walk around the garden. Worth the visit!
Muiderslot,skullkiller0980,5,Nice gardens with a large verity of plants from around the world. The actual castle was big (you would not want to fall in moat as didn’t look too clean) most rooms had some kind of explanation of the room or just some information and some nice views Plus a audio tour with 3 languages (English Dutch German) shop small but has interesting items like local honey and some old famous 20% alcohol drink (4 flavours) there’s also local free parking close by near a nice lake
Narva Muuseum,Jozef Jonas,5,"Large and very nice castle, but don’t expect to much. Everything is super modern inside, including elevators and video projection. Very few artefacts can be found here as the castle was completelly destroyed and build up recently. Gardens are currently under reconstruction."
Narva Muuseum,Igor P,5,"Very informative stands that tell not only about the history of the fortress, but also about why this particular reconstruction option was chosen, how complex all modern communications are in a medieval building, and much more."
Narva Muuseum,Boris Meleshov,5,"Narva Castle has seen massive investments, which resulted in opening new areas, addition of new interactive expositions (also suitable for children). The museum is fairly big and requires a lot of climbing (30 or 50m). Certainly a place to see if you want to learn about importance of the town. Aleksander - excellent English speaking guide."
Narva Muuseum,Willian Fernandes,5,"Really enjoy that museum, it’s very accessible to all English speakers and many things to see inside. You won’t regret."
Narva Muuseum,Geoffrey Poynter,5,"Museum in the castle. It's great! Lots of rooms to explore, great views from the tower and fabulous visual displays"
Walzin Castle,Richard King,5,"Nice castle on top of the mountain!  Parking is limited at the end of the road. You need to get lucky if there is a spot free. Parking at the hotel earlyer on the road is not allowed (they have signs that they will tow your car)  You can walk alot there castle is from a private owner, not possible to enter."
Walzin Castle,roberta pascolini,5,"Kayaking the Lesse River is a wonderful experience, especially when you stand in front of this majestic and amazing castle: I didn't visit it, but I think it'd be a magic experience"
Walzin Castle,Yeasir Arafat Zaman,5,Beautifully mesmerising place. It is a bit of a work to reach there but the view is worth it.
Walzin Castle,MLVC CN,5,"One of the best castles I have visited in Belgium based on its location, beauty, and the area where it was built. It is not accessible to public. Kayaking is a good option to have a nearer view. Worth a place to do hiking. I have visited this area several times and in different seasons and I would say that it is always magnificent."
Walzin Castle,Jake Taqtics,5,Beautiful castle on top of a rock! Best way to visit is by kayak! You can rent one from Dinant Evasion. Its about 12km and the castle is around half way of your kayak tour! Best time to visit is during summer. Water levels might be a problem depending on how much it rained during spring.
Stokesay Castle,Linda Manas,4,This is a really beautiful medieval Manor House. It is so lovely. The church is well worth a visit too. Lovely walk and view from the back in front of the pond although the water level was very low. Nice gift shop. I’m glad I went to the cafe last rather than first based on previous reviews about waiting times. I found the younger lady in the cafe rather abrupt. She informed me that the kitchen closed at 3 pm ( I had not realised this) and that it was 3:17 pm. I found this to be verging on impertinence. I would visit the site again but not the cafe. I would take a packed lunch.
Stokesay Castle,High Miler,4,Its a nice place to visit some good quests for kids on the way around. Good information around the place and alot of it is indoors so mostly ok for a rainy day too. But at about £32 for a family in the summer holidays its overpriced unless you have a membership. They also try and charge you £3 to park on top if your honest and actually pay it. You can see the whole site in an hour maybe 2 max if you take your time.
Stokesay Castle,Lauren Sullivan,5,Beautiful 'castle' (fortified house) with lovely views. The solar room with the carved fireplace is stunning. The audio tour is really good. We really enjoyed the garden areas too. Well worth a visit.
Stokesay Castle,Jonathan Hoare,5,"Idyllic castle and very unusual - guaranteed great photos from any angle whatever the weather. My second visit and I think I loved it more! Small and compact, it's easy to navigate. The kids trail was really good, inventive and with a great ending. For everyone else you can wander with limited information or take the audio guide for more informative tours. Lovely cafe by the car park too."
Stokesay Castle,Hazel Lowe,4,"Lovely place to visit but it is a manor house rather than a castle. Lots of old spiral staircases which should be considered by those with limited mobility. Book online to save money. I've only scored 4 stars because parking is an additional £3 on top of the entrance fee which, in my opinion should be included"
State Historical and Architectural Reserve Kho...,Iren Oliinik,5,"I haven't even expected this is such a splendid location. I appreciate a lot the labor of scientists, that are restoring it step by step. Highly recommended"
State Historical and Architectural Reserve Kho...,Sandeep Deshmukh,5,"Beautiful Fortress in Khotyn...  The city was set up in 1621... so it's celebrating 400th anniversary in 2021...  The Fortress has a grand vast and green area around it (but within its outer perimeter wall), a grand and beautiful cathedral located next to it... but the main attraction is the Fortress itself...  It has an impressive majestic look of a traditional European Fortress, a wooden drawbridge at the entrance, huge towering stone walls with conical towers giving an impressive look...  A great collection of old artifacts are on display along with various rooms and compartments that give a good picture of the life in the Fortress in the olden days...  We couldn't see any paid guide or audio guide... but during peak tourist season, there may be some... A tourist guide would have been a good help for us to understand the history better...  Overall, it was a fantastic experience for us."
State Historical and Architectural Reserve Kho...,William Anderson,5,Historical old Fortress Indeed! Totally worth the 6.5 hour drive from Kiev to check out the fortresses in the area of Kamianets-Podilskyi! This one was in pretty good shape and maintenance and upkeep was being conducted during our visit. Crazy history of the different people who occupied the fortress over the years.  I especially appreciated the old paintings and weapons cellar!
State Historical and Architectural Reserve Kho...,Mariya Tuzyk,5,Massive fortress overlooking the Dnister river in Khotyn. Inside the fortress walls you can see some historical artifacts. The territory is vast and you can roam alongside the fort walls for some time. You can bring a picnic and sit atop the hills for a spectacular view of the fort and river. There are also some crafts available for purchase from pottery to wooden goods near the entrance.
State Historical and Architectural Reserve Kho...,Artur Rydczak,5,One of the biggest fortress I ever seen the dimension of the walls and the place by the river surrounded by hills make this place very precious. It's one of this places you must see in Ukraine.
Tower of London,Arun Joy,5,"One of the most iconic buildings in London, with a history as long as the City itself, having survived multiple wars and pandemics. Lots of history, lots to see and read about and obviously the crown jewels which are the star of the show. Make sure you give yourself 4-5 hours to see the place fully. There is an audio guide for an extra £5 which I would recommend. Also attend the tour conducted by the Yeomen Warders, which runs hourly and lasts for about 2 hours. A must visit attraction if you are in London."
Tower of London,Gillian Hemphill,5,"Amazing place to visit. I recommend the tour by the Beefeater. Very knowledgeable and very funny. Big queue for the Crown Jewels once you got inside the Tower, but well worth the wait. There are lots of things to see as well as crown jewels too. The Cafe  inside is great. And when you leave, the exit takes you to a spot beside the Thames with awesome views of Tower Bridge."
Tower of London,Michael Blok,5,"There's a big line to get in, often really big, and it's pretty pricey, but all worth it. At least the weather here is usually not too hot or cold, so nobody has died yet from exposure whilst waiting ;-) The location by the river is very beautiful, you get to see a 1,000 year old castle and England's crown jewels. It's best to book in advance online. After you're done, visit the Tower Bridge to see it from above."
Tower of London,Yess Min,5,amazing experience.  we didn’t get the audio guide but we got the free map which brings us around the whole castle. spent around 3 hours. it was amazing and worth the money!
Tower of London,Donnalese Desiral,4,Stunning! If nothing else go to see the Crown Jewels. They were absolutely stunning! Of course u cannot take photos of them. That’s NOT allowed!!! But it’s a site to see. Trust me!
Cochem Castle,Rachel Anne,5,Lovely castle! The tour we took was around 35 minutes and was very interesting hearing the history about the castle. The views of the city below are breathtaking and the castle itself is like a fairytale. There is a restaurant there but I did not eat so I can't comment on that. Overall very nice day trip.
Cochem Castle,Romeo,5,Beatiful castle and great for the day trip. You can go inside the castle for a paid tour with a guide. The castle is full of well preserved artifacts and beautiful art works. It's also interesting to know the history of the castle. There's a bar at the end of the tour with a view over looking Cochem city.
Cochem Castle,Hashim Fakhreddin,4,"Beautiful castle on mountain top. Stunning views towards the castle from the city and stunning views from the castle looking at the city.  Must get a ticket €8.50 to enter the castle which includes a tour, The English tour runs every hour or so, the tour was really good and insightful for the history of the castle, the time period and architecture.  The souvenir shop prices were quite high, eltz Castle souvenir shop was much better."
Cochem Castle,Scott Green,5,"Great day trip. Perfect to take family and anyone you might have visiting. The castle is a bit of a hike up a fairly steep hill, but the views from the top are worth it. Went in the early spring and I imagine the vineyards on the hill sides look spectacular come midsummer."
Cochem Castle,Surupa Chaki,5,Absolutely fairytale town with a beautiful castle hilltop. The way to castle from center is 30 -40 min walk uphill and very pleasant scenery. Recommend to spend a day or a day trip which I did is also fine. Must take a boat trip to view the castle from river. Town center is so cute well preserved medieval.
Edinburgh Castle,Kiran K,5,It was far beyond my expectations. The Castle and its history is a really breathtaking experience.  Have to walk a lot inside the castle to explore all the hidden treasures. Importantly the 👑 Crown.  Got spectacular views of the city from the top of the Castle. Totally an awesome historical must visit place.
Edinburgh Castle,Chace Guild,4,"Excellent venue for the annual Royal Military Tattoo as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.  I’ve attended the Tattoo twice now, several years apart, and it has yet to disappoint as a spectacle of military bands and marching prowess. The coordination involved is incredible, especially at the culmination of the show with the massed pipes and drums.  The castle itself sits ominously over the city centre, being visible for miles around and at several points around city. Several nice walks are available around the grounds and up to the front gates, affording plenty of opportunities for photographers."
Edinburgh Castle,Vicky Dunbar,5,"Book tickets in advance as you're not guaranteed entry if you just turn up. The website is easy to use, there are many time slots to choose from and you get a long window to arrive within. This place is truly spectacular and there is so much to see on site that you could spend much longer here than you'll plan for. St Margarets Chapel is small but the stained glass is beautiful. The Crown Jewels are well worth the queue and were the highlight for me until I entered the Scottish National War Memorial building. Absolutely amazing! The Regimental museums and National War museum are glorious, so much information and memorabilia. Be sure to be on time for the one o'clock gun! The Great Hall is fabulous, the ceiling alone! The replicas of Mary Queen of Scots embroideries are exquisite so don't miss those. You'll really appreciate the amount of work that's went into them. There are plenty of toilets around and cafes to stop for coffee and a snack. We spent a good 3 hours here and probably still missed things"
Edinburgh Castle,James,5,"A beautiful castle filled with a lot of history. Tickets need to be booked in advance (preferably over 24 hours) and there is so much to see.  There are the Scottish Crown Jewels and Stone of Destiny, WWII memorial, great hall, former Scottish royalty residences, prisons/dungeons, a war memorial, the 1 PM cannon, and a beautiful structure.  My favorite fact is that to please Queen Victoria, a moat and the Eastern entrance was put in!"
Edinburgh Castle,Pravda Pupkina,5,"It was a great experience! Regardless of the rain we walked all over the grounds listening to our guide telling stories. After the tour we looked at all the buildings again, cannons, chapel, even little graveyard for dogs.    Overall happy we visited it."
Divina Aurora Sociedad Cooperativa Valenciana,Marcos Lledó,5,"In this life everything has a solution. Including death, the solution, Divine Aurora."
Divina Aurora Sociedad Cooperativa Valenciana,Nati F,5,One of the best funeral chest factories
Bevan Buckland LLP,sharon duffy,5,always have excellent service 👍
Castell de Morella,Vincent Aun,4,"It's a little town on the hill, with an ancient church building, though small it's very unique worth to explore even though you may have seen many.  The castle on the top is a ruine, ancient but nothing much to see. The streets in the middle of the hill are just like any other Spanish town."
Castell de Morella,Richard Wakefield,4,Great castle - imagination and historical knowledge will help. Worth a trot up to the top for the views alone but the cave exhibit was a very pleasant surprise - very tasteful indeed. It’s cheap too so a must-see if nearby.
Castell de Morella,high stoned,5,"Very nice castle and town, really grand with all walls and towers still standing. Town is not ruined by souvenir shops, but still has a nice atmosphere."
Castell de Morella,Fiona Birnie,5,"Stunning sweet city hidden behind the castle walls, a must visit and great views from the free aire across the road well done Spain beautiful gem"
Castell de Morella,Jamal Yo,5,"The castle sits at the top of the hill covering whole village and giving an amazing view from the outside of village. Very picturesque. The village itself has that medieval soul in it. Narrow alleys, buildings, the atmosphere."
Pousada do Castelo de Óbidos,David Goodrow,5,"This hotel was one of the most unique places we have ever stayed at.  The room was a good value and the breakfast buffet was excellent.  Yes the supper we had the night we checked in was the most expensive meal out entire trip, but it was superb.  We could not have had a better dining experience."
Pousada do Castelo de Óbidos,Patrick Cecconi,1,"I booked a room at this hotel paying an expensive rate (Eur 449 for 2 nights breakfast included) thinking I was going to stay for a couple of nights in a romantic and luxurious castle with my wife, but instead we found ourselves in a prison cell! When we  arrived the village was full of tourists for a mideveal feast, we had to leave the car on the street outside the village's walls and the reception was not able to give us instructions as to where to park and even refused to give us a hand to bring the baggage to the hotel. The breakfast was acceptable, but service is slow.  After having complained vigorously and published this review we were transferred to a standard room in the castle. A small, but much more comfortable room for the second night."
Pousada do Castelo de Óbidos,Chaim Schlezinger,4,"Located on top of the hill, a very special hotel. You will experience unique atmosphere, great view from each room. However, this is not 5 stars hotel, rooms are very basic, maybe 2 stars and the price is 5 stars."
Pousada do Castelo de Óbidos,Jill Lantz,5,"We had a great two night stay, it was especially nice being able to walk the town in the evening when everything was quiet.  All the staff is nice and helpful. I would especially like to give a shout out to Guilherme, has was amazing and gave us the best recommendations!!"
Pousada do Castelo de Óbidos,Pamela Miller,4,"Beautiful place, stunning rooms but sadly a connecting room with no noise mitigation. They were not noisy people but we could hear each other clearly. Added to a firm bed and thin pillows it did not make for a restful night"
Saaremaa Muinsuskaitse Selts,Veljo Puujalg,4,Ok
Château de Beynac,Vincent V,4,"Steep climbing to get to the castle. Make sure to go early or low temperatures. 11,50 euro entry per adult is ok, there's enough to see. Guided tour with your own telephone by scanning qr codes."
Château de Beynac,Catherine Shawarby,4,"Steep climb up from the river but we’ll worth the climb. Audio guides available from QR codes, not the easiest to follow but informative. Amazing views of the surrounding area. Couple of nice restaurants outside of the chateau itself."
Château de Beynac,Ron Machielse,4,Very nice castle being restaured to how it used to be in the late 1600's. Most rooms are lightly decorated. Very well done is the room where Richard Lionhart was held prisoner.  Good panoramic views from the castle. Large parking space at the beginnig of the village. For those who are not into climming I advise to use the much smaller parking near the entrance of the chateau.
Château de Beynac,Christopher Eadon,5,"Very impressive and well worth the 9.5 euros admissions fee. How industrious our ancestors where! There are bars, cafes and shops at the top. 30 minutes walk up, but very rewarding."
Château de Beynac,Paul G,4,Impressive. Not madly busy. A few small shops. Parking easy enough early Saturday afternoon in July. Only 3 euros. Dodgy toilet facilities only black mark.
Rocca di Gradara,Allan Meredith,4,"Visited the castle, cool place to visit."
Rocca di Gradara,Ivan Kine,4,"A nice tour inside the Rocca, from the torture room up to the halls and rooms. The chambers are still furnished and several weapons are on display. It is possible to buy the ticket for the walkways that run above the walls together with the ticket for the Rocca, very nice and with a beautiful view all around. The boys pay a symbolic ticket. I recommend going around both the Rocca and the walkways."
Rocca di Gradara,Luce Visione Percezione Pedrotti Elena,5,"Well preserved castle and furnished with period furniture, the story of Paolo and Francesca in the background makes everything more magical! It is worth taking the guided tour to learn about interesting details of the history of the castle and its owners, even if the guide was a bit too fast and the girls had a hard time following it..."
Rocca di Gradara,Giuseppe Calò,5,"If you are on holiday in Romagna or if you are passing by, take a half day to enjoy a fantastic experience in this magnificent village. I must have passed it hundreds of times and yet it hadn't gone unnoticed, you can see it very well from the motorway, I had never found a way to stop. So what did I think to do? Taking advantage of the April 25 long weekend, I gave myself a holiday in Gradara. What can I say, the village as well as the fortress are kept very well. The visit of the castle lasted about an hour. It was a super interesting experience, going through the rooms of this majestic structure, one has the feeling of being thrown back in time. I recommend the guided tour, alternatively, you can rely on the descriptive signs, placed inside, which explain the history of each individual room in a clear and exhaustive way."
Rocca di Gradara,Francesco Martinelli,4,"The internal tour is suggestive and quite beautiful. I was expecting something more, but maybe it's just my expectations. The internal rooms are very fresh and the reconstructions of the clothes of the time are beautiful. Very nice village with its narrow streets and characteristic corners. It is advisable to park under the walls, even if expensive..."
Castle of Alegrete,Helena Silva,4,Small castle in ruins but well kept. Free panoramic binoculars for sightseeing.
Castle of Alegrete,Alexandra Alves,4,"Good monument to visit, situated in a charismatic town. The castle is free to visit and it is well preserved, although the informational apparatus it's not at it's best shape already. At the top of the walls you can also have a great view of the surroundings. Recommend it."
Castle of Alegrete,André Lencastre,5,Amazing view of the village and surrounding hills. There are several modern walkways and ladders for an easier access to the walls and towers.
Castle of Alegrete,Sam Burroughs,4,Well maintained and a great view! Small quiet town with a couple of bar/restaurants.
Castle of Alegrete,Thomas Tingstrup,5,Stunning place
Alcazaba,Mike ORiordan,5,"Very enjoyable visit for just €3.50 with a QR code on display inside the entrance you can access the multilingual audio tour, this makes for an easy 1 hour 30 mins self guided tour of one of Málaga’s dominant historical structures. Free Audio tour is a must to enhance your visit all Complimented by great views of the city and port."
Alcazaba,Mishkaah G,4,"Gorgeous and inexpensive, but a challenging/steep walk and loads of steps. Thought I wouldn't make it up in the sweltering heat 😂 Wear comfy shoes. Remarkable views of Malaga so it's definitely worthwhile."
Alcazaba,Lawrence Baca,5,Very interesting palace/fortification built in the years of Muslim occupation in Spain. The beautiful architecture and gardens are well worth the visit. The admission price is insignificant compared to the sights to be seen. Excellently maintained but there is only so much that can be done for accessibility. Lots of steps and some are steep to see everything. Ramp and/or elevator at both entrances.
Alcazaba,Liwia Szczęsna,5,"The Alcazaba Castle is stunning, it is located in the historic centre of Málaga and you can feel the history that took place there as you walk on the same paths as people hundred years ago. It is well preserved and you can see whole city from the top of the castle. It is one of the most known tourist attractions in the city, but for a reason. I recommend reading a little bit before you go there so when you are actually there you can imagine all the history that took place there as you walk. I love the architecture of the place and have good memories from there."
Alcazaba,Jude Platton,5,"Very fun place to visit and less busy than expected. Very peaceful place with good views for those who don't want to climb up to the castle (Very tiring in the heat). Price of entry (2,50 € for both venues for students) was an absolute bargain."
Mont Orgueil Castle,Wei Gardens,4,"1. It’s amazing to see the history behind! 2. It’s well maintained 3. There’s only one little issue: you have no idea where to go to find the entrance. Luckily the local souvenir store owner Ewa’s so kind and explained to me. 4. One way is starting from the wall with stairs all the way up ( hard) The other is next to the public toilets, there’s a ramp- easier"
Mont Orgueil Castle,Mary Campbell,5,What an amazing place to visit! We spent over 2 hrs here listening to our guide (free) telling us about the shenanigans through history. These talks aren't usually for me but Geoff (volunteer on Fridays) was informative and also had a great sense of humour which helped no end!! The castle and the bay are AMAZING plenty of places to eat and drink and the Liberty bus takes you right there.... please visit!!!!
Mont Orgueil Castle,deborah Rosen,5,"Steps. Lots of steps! Not for those with bad knees but great to wander round. Throw a penny in the wishing well, learn its history and take in the stunning views. Watch out for the lizards too."
Mont Orgueil Castle,Alan Stokes,5,"This is a fantastic castle. It's huge, with lots to explore. There's some WW2 additions, and you can see the other developments over the centuries. Great views out over the town, sea, and even to France in the distance. Well explained, and with some clever use of art and sculpture to illuminate the history. One of the best I've been to - and I've been to a lot."
Mont Orgueil Castle,Hamzah Hamid,5,"This castle is definitely worth a visit, a fun trip all in all! Great to read about the history and also the local area - businesses, wildlife, marine life. Great views all around and plenty of opportunities for pictures too."
Castle of Almansa,babalu roots,5,"I loved the castle. It's still well conserved, it's easy to go up but I advise you to put sport shoes on you. The museum is interesting and take care of the last scale, cargol stairs. Bonito con bonitas vistas de la ciudad, recomendable para un fin de semana cualquiera."
Castle of Almansa,florencia costamagna,5,"Fantastic experience. The staff is so friendly and helpful, definitely must spend a bit of your time just to have a fresh chat and learn something more about the castle and town. All explained in Spanish and English and easy to follow. Child friendly, with the perfect size to keep them entertained. Great views too!"
Castle of Almansa,Jedrzej Kocinski,5,Interesting place.  But remember to check opening hours. It is closed between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.
Castle of Almansa,Ronda Zelezny-Green,5,"Spain has a ton of castles turned museums and tourist spots. However, this is the best one we have been to so far. Clean, well organized, beautiful architecture, delightful restoration touches, beautiful views, and friendly staff. Although not fully wheelchair accessible there are some spots that even people who are wheelchair bound can enjoy. We really loved it and will definitely visit again soon. It is very family friendly and there is plenty of parking nearby."
Castle of Almansa,Letitia Bourke,3,Only ok at the moment because you can only walk round it. It has been closed for restorations for some time but I think it'll be opening soon. Almansa is a lovely little picturesque town and the castle will be a 5 star attraction when it opens to the public.
Suscinio Castle,Arie Rozichner,4,"Very nice castle with interesting history and legends. Situated in a beautiful environment with nice views to nearby nature and distant shores. The only (yet big) disadvantage is a complete lack of English language descriptions of much interesting information provided inside. Surely, one can get along using Google translation, as we did. But come on, for a hefty 11.50 Eur I expect more than just taking a picture out of the window."
Suscinio Castle,Byron Ravenscroft,5,"We timed our visit to coincide with  a travelling medieval company that put on a magnificent show. There were pottery makers, blacksmiths, knights, maidens and more. There is crossbow shooting for all ages. The knights put on a show with their horses and there was a battle amongst the knights which was thouroughly enjoyed by all. The castle itself offers a walkthrough of the entire place with displays of the period."
Suscinio Castle,Brendan McGrath,5,"A fantastic castle and great value for €11.50 for adults. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy even with it being a Bank Holiday. The entrance fee lets you tour the castle, have a go with a crossbow and row a boat around the moat. There was more but we ran out of time!We highly recommend it."
Suscinio Castle,Louati Aymen,5,"Castle Suscinio is a royal castle located in Brittany, northwest France. Located near the bay of Morbihan, this castle was built in the 13th century and was once a favorite vacation spot of Britons. With its beautiful architecture and location in the middle of a large garden, Suscinio castle attracts visitors with its wildness and diverse history. Today, it has become a popular tourist destination, where people can explore the ancient rooms and city walls and enjoy the lush green space surrounding the castle."
Suscinio Castle,Brian Ruigrok,5,"We spent a great day here, between the visits and the entertainment everyone had a very good time. The evening light show was both interesting and entertaining. A good children's activity book was provided which kept the kids busy and entertained. As a bilingual family it was not a problem but it was surprising that there were not more descriptions in English."
Military Autonomous Command Sicily,Salvatore Biondo,5,"Nice place to visit in october for the ""treasure way"" will be open"
Military Autonomous Command Sicily,Raniero Casini,3,It is not an everyday thing to stand in front of a door that leads to one of the fundamental military commands of the Italian Army.
Hotel Cap d'Or,Alex McColl,5,"Lovely little hotel in an amazing location right by the beach and at the base of the castle. The staff made us feel very welcome despite us not speaking Spanish and made our Tossa de Mar visit that much better. Our room faced the beach and had a large comfy bed, air conditioning and a small but suitable bathroom. Beach towels were complementary and the included breakfast had all you need. Note if you are driving you will need to plan ahead regarding parking."
Hotel Cap d'Or,M. B. R.,1,"Awful experience. The owner shouting a kid and her mother because the kid was crying and she could not stand the noise.  I find it terrifying that a professional ridicules in front of all the clients a little girl who is having a tantrum and questioning the good work of her mother. We all know how hard it is to rise a kid and that kids often have these “moments”, which may not be the ideal for everyone, but they are just KIDS (3 year old).  This is why I think that this hotel / restaurant is not aproppriate for families."
Hotel Cap d'Or,Nika Stafford,5,I cannot say enough about this charming hotel. The staff is wonderful and very attentive....my room was small and an absolute delight. The food is amazing and the location cannot be beat !! I was travelling alone and I felt right at home.
Hotel Cap d'Or,Frida Nguyen,5,Perfect spot for morning coffee. The view is incredible and the French riverian interior design of the hotel is super cute! 🥰
Hotel Cap d'Or,tami hahami piterbarg,2,"Great location- but…  unfortunately that is all. This hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment. We paid 180 € -off season- for a tiny little room with a  broken air conditioning!! The owners pretended as if they did not know about this problem, however the floor underneath the air conditioner, told us a different story… maybe other rooms are better- make sure which one you get."
Randonnée du château de Reinhardstein,Marina Vasilev,4,Walking tour of the cascade was not possible due to a broken bridge. Castle tour is nice but not very suitable for younger children. It takes a bit too long and the information given is more for adults. Surroundings and location castle is beautiful. At the foot of the castle is a restaurant with very friendly ladies.
Randonnée du château de Reinhardstein,stefanie van Dijk,4,"There are several walks to do, I have kept it to a small round; from the path to the castle turn right Cascade and after the waterfall follow the same signs but then in the opposite direction. That is about 6 km. Nice view of the castle, nice pieces through the forest and a rest at the waterfall. Because of the foliage you can only see the lower part, the higher part is out of sight (probably easier to see in winter) On the 2nd part, most of the bridge is missing (damage from recent extreme weather?) only the concrete beams are still there, luckily you can hop over the stones underneath. At the foot of the castle you can stop for a snack or drink, with or without a visit to the castle (if open: weekends and Wednesdays and during school holidays) All in all a nice walk"
Randonnée du château de Reinhardstein,Van deman,5,"nice walk on small paths, tough, with beautiful views and with the possibility to have a drink in the castle."
Randonnée du château de Reinhardstein,ik jij,5,Very enthusiastic guide who told fun in a beautiful castle
Randonnée du château de Reinhardstein,Karel De Neve,4,"Was a difficult route, especially with the children and grandparents."
Gravensteen,Bram aka Stitch,5,"Visit on: July 1, 2023 --- Reason to visit this castle? I already knew this fantastic castle but my girlfriend had never been there. Always talking about it with her, but never visiting, we decided to visit the Gravensteen.  Unfortunately it was a slightly grayer day, but that didn't take away the feeling. The castle, which has been present in Ghent for a long time, and has been used and reused by many, is magnificent to visit. My girlfriend could enjoy the view and the way the castle was built for a long time.  The visit itself was super good and the staff was always friendly and helpful. From the top of the castle you have a great view over the city of Ghent.  Visit it and let yourself be surprised! Well worth a visit!"
Gravensteen,chesa,5,This is such an interesting castle/museum and a must visit when in Ghent! The audio guide was entertaining. There are a lot of spots to sit and listen to the stories. I recommend you get the ticket online in advance.
Gravensteen,Mirja Viita-aho,5,My favourite part of our daytrip to Ghent. The audio tour was entertaining even though I usually prefer exploring without audio but it was included in the ticket price and was indeed a great addition as it felt like listening to a story. The castle itself looks amazing and is definitely worth a visit.
Gravensteen,Sabyasachi Dey Sarkar,5,"A place to be if one is in Belgium. Its superb, serene, peaceful, amazingly and breathtakingly beautiful and wonderful in every sense. Unfortunately the weather on the day we visited Ghent was not in our full favour, however the visit was all worth despite the rain."
Gravensteen,Fun For Stephen,5,"The castle is built on a mound and is surrounded by a moat. It has a central keep, which is 70 feet tall, and a number of other buildings, including a chapel, a prison, and a dungeon. The castle is known for its torture chambers, which are now on display to the public."
Alcázar de Segovia,Dan Lu,5,"Most people walk around inside the town, but you should get out of the stone wall and enjoy the view from outside. It would not disappoint your kids to bring them to the castle which is distinctive by virtue of its shape - like the bow of a ship. Has served as a royal palace for 22 monarchs, it has a rich history and beautiful art and architecture."
Alcázar de Segovia,Stoian Roxana,3,"Take care, the tower is not always open. Overall this is a nice relaxing old building, well preserved and well restored, it deserves your attention. Moreover, you have some awesome views from the terrace."
Alcázar de Segovia,E Ram,5,"This is a great place to go see. The aqueduct, the castle, and the sites fit right into our plans to see multiple cities in the Madrid area. We did a two city tour in one day and it was well worth the time."
Alcázar de Segovia,Charissa Cheong,5,One of the most if not the most beautiful castle listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site just 75 mins away drive from Madrid! A must see when in Segovia! Visit at sunset during summer months (open til 8pm)  to experience a romantic stroll through the palace walls and garden. Fun Fact: Apparently Walt Disney’s Cinderella’s Castle was inspired by this particular castle.
Alcázar de Segovia,Michael Allen,5,What a fantastic experience for everyone.  Young and old can come here and experience a castle and the beautiful scenery.  The views from up on the castle are amazing.  The walk to the castle is fun with shops and eateries along the way just remember that between 2-5 you’re gonna miss out on a lot of them.
Château de la Roche-Jagu,Roderick Swaries,5,"The Chateau offers an exceptional visitor experience. The basic house visit allows you to understand it’s place in local history. A 6€ per person ticket allows access to the upper floors, where life at the Chateau and it’s various rooms are explained. In summer you have a bonus in getting to see whatever exhibition is displayed. This year’s was insects built from old musical instruments, stunning. The gardens offer excellent displays for each season. The Cafe is great, you need to book for lunchtime, tea, coffee and cakes are available throughout the day without booking. Texts are provided in English to support the display narratives, which are in French. I have visited many times and will return."
Château de la Roche-Jagu,Jo Marshall,5,Beautiful day and beautiful place to spend the day. The exhibition was an added bonus.. Can definitely recommend a visit and a drink in the cafe bar..
Château de la Roche-Jagu,Nina V,4,The art exhibition on the interior floors of the second and third levels made the chateau more interesting. Otherwise it would be cavernous rooms and small niches/alcoves to look at. The garden was delightful and I could see spending time picnic-ing on the lawns.
Château de la Roche-Jagu,Eugene van Veldhoven,5,"Impressive location, beautiful castle and gardens, all tastefully maintained, and a terrace with a great view"
Château de la Roche-Jagu,Madeleine Neilly,5,Beautiful landscape & gardens. Great château! Perfect for peaceful and relaxing walks.
Castles of Bellinzona,H. Toh,4,"One of the best Castle, is Free entrance unless you wish to go up to the tower there is a charge. You must take a lift, is located at the end of dark tunnel and hidden at the end of plaza. The view is astonishing but ver windy!"
Castles of Bellinzona,Julian Moor,4,The Castle at the bottom is full of tourists. The castle in the middle is beautiful and I recommend you'll go there by e-bike. I recommend the middle one the most because its quite big and just a raw medieval castle without any fancy exhibitions. The top one is quite small in comparison to the other two.
Castles of Bellinzona,Patrick Hug,5,"Great place to visit and discover with kids. Free entrance and countless corners, tunnels, walls for kids to scramble through. After visiting Castelgrande walk up to Montebello for a picnic and to finish of have an ice-cream in the city centre."
Castles of Bellinzona,C R,5,This castle was a great place to visit while in Bellinzona. Great views of the surrounding nature and not far from the restaurants and cafes. I definitely recommend visiting.
Castles of Bellinzona,Marianne “Tin Lizzie Traveler” Eubanks,5,Beautiful views. Look for the tunnel with the elevator to enter. Be sure to go all the way around to the horse tunnel that runs the length of the wall almost 1k. If you have time go inside to the museum and see all the paintings found just recently during a renovation of a local home.
Łańcut Castle,Karolina Vikyol,4,Beautiful palace with a picturesque well maintained park surrounding it. Free entry on Mondays makes it very crowded though and there’s a ridiculous policy forbidding you to enter the gardens with a dog.
Łańcut Castle,Olga Klein,5,"Great park and palace to visit, with friends and family. There is huge English park around with a lake, and close to the palace there is smaller Italian garden with fountains and flowers. Palace is well maintained. One big minus it is hard to get in. At May holidays they said that all tickets sold out to see the exhibition inside of the palace. And on the website I couldn't find an option to buy online. That was very upsetting as we came from far. And tickets are for a certain hour, eventhought they said 20 visitors per 10 min, till closing there were no spare spots. In this case we could just enter the Italian garden for 2 zł per person, and Orchid garden, for 10 zł, which actually is super small as part of it close se for visiting. This part I would not repeat. Recommendation is to find a way to buy ticket earlier."
Łańcut Castle,anna afek,5,"A very beautiful palace. If you are nearby, you can spend a day at this picturesque location. Sightseeing tours available  in English. Visit the website to find out before visiting about guided tours. Extensive grounds, very large palace, cheap entrance fees. The guide was very competent, interesting and funny. It's best to visit it on warmer days. There is a cafe / restaurant and gift shop on site."
Łańcut Castle,Oleg Leonov,5,"Lovely place I visited by accident. Absolutely not planned affair resulted in wonderful time spent walking in the shadows of very old trees and enjoying views. Entrance to internal gardens is not free, but the fee is minimal. There is a cafe inside, so you can get refreshment drinks or some basic dishes. Couple of hours of great time is guaranteed, strongly advised."
Łańcut Castle,Anjaneai Srivastava,4,"It appears a very ordinary castle from outside but its a stunning work of art, architecture and comfort from inside. The history of its governors and Kings is quiet interesting. It's takes 45 mins approx to visit it from start to end. You are offered multi lingual audio guide as well as a personal guide if you like. The audio guide ticket is 28zl. All in all its good way to start a Sunday!"
Methoni Castle,John K96,5,"Excellent Castle, plenty of space to explore and to walk, plus the view of the sea is wonderful. It is also cleaned and taken care of by the authorities and it is safe to explore. Make sure to use comfy shoes for the slipping stones and take water because the heat can exhaust you on the top."
Methoni Castle,Peter James,5,A Step Back in Time: Visiting the derelict castle in Methoni felt like stepping into a captivating medieval world. The historical charm and picturesque views made it an unforgettable experience. I was truly mesmerized by the rich history and stunning architecture.
Methoni Castle,Lester D.R. Thompson,5,"Isolated and off the beaten path, this sea-side castle complex is fantastic. While the majority of the site is in ruins, you can still get a sense of the once majestic structures. Almost deserted, you can easily explore at your heart's content."
Methoni Castle,Daskalo N,5,Fantastic to visit! So beautiful to walk to the end and have all the views! Check the open times during the summer months and the winter as it alters! It’s a must once in Methoni and the area around 😊💙🇬🇷
Methoni Castle,Zoe Vavali,5,Very impressed by this place! The ticket price is just 3€ and the castle has so many spots to explore. We visited it around 19.00 and the sun was almost setting 👌🏽.
Trojský zámek,Sarka Bejckova (SharkieBe),5,"I visited the Trojsky zamek on my walk from Bohnice to Troja. It was late afternoon and the gardens were still opened. There were almost no people so I enjoyed the beautiful calm garden, the views and also the apple trees growing there."
Trojský zámek,Sarah O'Neil,5,"really cool place to walk around with great sculptures and gardens. the labyrinth is so awesome!! there is a museum inside as well and it is nice, mostly just frescos if you’re into that."
Trojský zámek,Lina H.,5,"Amazing place, I was excited to see it all alive. Especially on early spring there no people at all, especially at the work days. So I had a strong feeling that it's all mine"
Trojský zámek,František,5,Beautiful structure with gorgeous gardens right in front of the Prague Zoo.
Trojský zámek,Evgeniya Kiskonen,5,"Wow, the place is incredible! The garden is calm, beautiful and not crowded at all. Great place for a weekend walk. A museum inside of the castle is really interesting and beautiful! Hold your breath till you get to the chapel room. Overall, it’s a hidden gem in Prague."
National Trust - Penrhyn Castle & Garden,Damian Cannon,5,This is one stunning (fake) castle built with money drawn from sugar plantations and slate mines. The place is huge as are the interior rooms and the stone carving is incredible.  The estate outside is also beautiful with wonderful long views across the estuary and to the mountains. There's a great walled garden and some lovely walks through the trees.  The cafe serves standard NT fare but really you don't come here for the food. Instead prepare to be wowed by the sheer amount of money spent creating this estate.
National Trust - Penrhyn Castle & Garden,Patricia Jenkins,4,"Beautiful castle, stunning building and really interesting history. Didn’t think much of the cafe or restaurant, very basic choice of food and small small seating area (ironically if you want decent coffee I’d head to the restaurant, not the cafe). The walled garden was pleasant but nothing spectacular. But for the castle itself it was absolutely worth the visit."
National Trust - Penrhyn Castle & Garden,Tracey Lane,5,"WOW, if you want to visit a stunning castle in North Wales then this is a must. Glorious views, the castle itself is outstanding.  The walled garden is beautiful.  There is a train museum which is small but amazing.  The castle inside is very ornate, with incredibly carved walls, ceilings and furniture.  The black staircase is outstanding.  One place to put on your bucket list."
National Trust - Penrhyn Castle & Garden,Chris C317,4,"First time visit here. The castle when you are walking up to it is very majestic set among the tree and shrub line. It made for some lovely photos.  Inside was smaller than I expected compared to others I’ve been too around the country. But there was enough to see as far as decor and history. We got there an hour before closing, so I guess the staff were winding down as there was hardly no one around to answer questions.  I was a little disappointed that you weren’t allowed to venture further into some corridors, and the information boards set about didn’t really go in depth about the history of the castle. It was a very light touch. But interesting nonetheless.  We didn’t venture to the garden walk, it was a wet day, so veered off to see the steam engines that were housed in the castle grounds. Quite interesting to see the history about the quarry and the locomotives that were used back in the day.  All in all, a lovely place to visit. I personally don’t think it warrants a second visit as it’s so small compared to other places I have visited. But recommended most definitely if you’re passing or visiting the area."
National Trust - Penrhyn Castle & Garden,Kasia Mężykowska,5,"Lovely place. It delights with its architecture, history and beautiful gardens. We had a great day with the whole family. The children's playground next to the castle is also a great idea for the youngest"
Castle of Ravadinovo,Paco Lazarov,2,Totally overpriced tourist trap  I had higher expectations 30bgn  No cards accepted at entrance. Workers without uniform asking for tickets. Leftover construction materials here and there. Toilet inside isn't free of charge????  The place is cooler for kids maybe.. kinda cheap imitation of game of thrones.  Cocktail and boring restaurant menus all over the place.  Parking looks like the place had opened 1hr ago.  Visitors are allowed to smoke freely inside  Total joke of an amusement park.  + Pets allowed  That's it !
Castle of Ravadinovo,Stanislava Dancheva,2,"Good but not as expected.When you hear the word ""castle"" you expect some kind of fairy tale. But here is not-nice flowers and green places and not more.You can't go really inside the castle. There is a basement with two room that you can visit for free.Secand disappointment is that you need to pay for toilet and gallery.They suppose to be in the fee for the entry. THE IDEA WAS GOOD BUT THE PRESENTATION IS SECOND CLASS."
Castle of Ravadinovo,Joe Kristiansen,4,"This is an interesting place. The grounds are fascinating. A lot of effort went into this.  Is it cliché? Absolutely. But in such an over the top way that you can't help but love it. Little details are everywhere. There were 3 points of access to the main building. The restrooms, an escape room (which I didn't try), and a little balcony.  If you come, pay attention to not just the layout and architecture but the materials as well. Honestly, it blew my mind. I recommend it as a great place to spend a few hours just poking around. If it hasn't been picked up as a movie location yet, I'm sure that will just be a matter of time."
Castle of Ravadinovo,sandra dean,5,"Beautiful castle , fairytale settings with beautiful gardens .Well worth a visit , the details that went into the bridges and the trash cans were disguised beautifully too We convinced out other half to dress up in stunning dresses and we had such a fun time ."
Castle of Ravadinovo,Raimundas Vaisvilas,4,"This place is different. From the start it made me interested. Nice calm music, beautiful entrance down halls. But there are also many things making this place kitsch. No cards, just cash. Very bad parking lot. Donkeys and other animals outside the castle. Village surroundings, aquapark. But in total it is worth to visit, especially with the kids, they enjoy this place"
Trakai Island Castle,Andy Smith,5,"This is a lovely castle and certainly worth a visit if you are staying in Vilnius or surrounding area. It makes a great day out. There is ample parking in the town and the castle is an easy walk. All the usual tourist souvenir shops are on the way. The castle is in excellent condition and has a large number of exhibits from around the area over the centuries. This are arranged in the rooms, mainly in the main keep. They cover different periods in the castle’s history. You can walk all around the castle, both around the outside and within. You can even rent a boat and go right round the outside. Some of the views across the lake are really nice, though there is nothing that really stands out. The gift shop is really good and actually cheaper than many of the market stalls in the village. I would certainly recommend a visit."
Trakai Island Castle,Nequs,5,"Some of the areas and rooms are not accesible anymore (I visited it few years ago) and it's probably because of too many tourists like other tourist places but overall its still a beautiful restored castle and I recommend to visit it. Most exhibitions and the history of items or places are explained in Lithuanian and English, few more are also in Polish and Russian languages. There's also a lake around the castle and a lot of restaurants and souvenir shops"
Trakai Island Castle,Ivan Vlahov,5,"A must visit place in Lithuania. Something extremely different from where I come from.  The place is so green and clean. There's an enormous lake hugging the castle grounds, in which you can rent a boat that takes you around it! The view is really amazing, loved walking around the castle.  The only thing about it is that it was super crowded on the weekend we visited. Hard to walk around the bridges to it. But it pays of! 🙌🏻"
Trakai Island Castle,Zura Balanchivadze,5,"It was a really nice experience to see the Baltic type of fortification. If you are a person who likes landscapes and historical architecture, this is a must see place in Lithuania. Note: it's a bit of a queue during high season."
Trakai Island Castle,Chandra Kanth Reddy,5,"If you ask me for one good place to see around Vilnius, it has to be this castle. This is perhaps the only good photo spot for me. Its a 45min-1hr by bus from Vilnius bus station, and then there is 30min of walk to castle each way, but worth the effort. Look at the pictures at different angles and different times for yourself"
Červená Lhota Restaurant,kamila chu,5,"Had late lunch at this restaurant after a visit to the castle. Service was very pleasant and food was excellent. Best we had in Czech Republic in a long time (Czech expat with family from Houston, Texas. Visiting every years or so) Not your typical menu but really nice presentation and yummy! Will be back!"
Červená Lhota Restaurant,Anis Kateb,1,Not worth it... try another place if you can.
Červená Lhota Restaurant,Monicka Bohacova,1,"Unfortunately today's visit was really desperate and I am really disappointed. It was a very nice, pleasant restaurant with very good food. We always went here with the family for lunch on the weekend. It is true that we have not been away for a long time, but what awaited us today was very desperate. The fact that there is only an open window I understand, technical problems, not enough staff, all this could be understood, but the quality of it all was crazy!!! Dirty tables, unmaintained space, quality of food? Totally crazy. Buns of perhaps the worst quality. Dry meat without taste. Drinks (allegedly kofola), which I didn't quite want to believe, but maybe yes, but from pipes that have not been maintained for a very long time. And the whole thing is covered there by the staff (more like children). Sometimes the lady from the office climbed in there, but we completely it didn't occur to her that she was there for anything useful. The one who is running it there now should think a lot about whether all this is not rather a disgrace to this beautiful place. It's a big shame, but we definitely won't be going there again, and judging by the reactions at the other tables next door, I'm sure we won't be the only ones."
Červená Lhota Restaurant,Jana Malá,1,"In one word, DISASTER They have a fast food delivery window. We waited 20 minutes for the chicken in a bun. The content did not match the price. So-so in terms of taste. There is nothing to spoil on boiled chicken, ice salads and bought buns. Never."
Červená Lhota Restaurant,Václav Kučírek,2,Homemade lemonade for 80 CZK (0.4 l) in a plastic cup is quite good. We preferred not to eat when we heard complaints from guests about hamburgers with almost no meat for 145 CZK. The toilets were not functional.
Ardvreck Castle,darren m,5,Lovely ruins of a historic old castle. There is a car park and a small walk but a lovely walk. There is also an information post telling you all about the castles history.
Ardvreck Castle,Ewald S,5,"Absolutely loved this experience. The ruins Are situated in one of the most picturesque areas I have seen. The grass, the water, the rocks the mountains. It feels like you are on the set of a movie."
Ardvreck Castle,Charles Bowman,3,"Small car park, a gentle walk. Now as castle destinations go, this is a ruin on land jutting out. Worth the 10 minutes it takes to stop walk there and back, but nothing huge to mention."
Ardvreck Castle,Jack Mitchell,5,"Great castle and house ruins, perfect for a picnic spot. Easy parking, but a short walk to the actual castle, no come prepared, especially when the loch is high, when you may need waterproof shoes to get across. It's definitely worth a visit. You can feel the history behind it. Also had great views of the mountains behind."
Ardvreck Castle,Stacey Beston,5,Lovely little ruins to visit. Makes for some great photographs. Easy to access Parking closely on either side of the road. Waterfall on opposite side  Big sign stated no camping and no dog fouling.
Schwerin Castle,amit kumar,5,Really nice and easy day trip from Berlin or Hamburg. The castle is picturesque and the castle garten is serene. Ideal for a relaxed weekend with family and kids. Loved it and definitely recommend it. Usually half a day is enough to see the entire town.
Schwerin Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"An extremely interesting castle located on the island. The number of towers is simply amazing, they look light and harmoniously fit into the ensemble of the castle, the surrounding garden, sculptures and landscape design. Entrance to the castle costs 8.5 euros. Inside you will see several very interesting rooms, including the throne room. This castle is worth a visit!"
Schwerin Castle,Kasun Alwis,5,"During my visit to Schwerin Castle, I was captivated by its exquisite beauty. The sheer magnificence of this historical landmark makes it an absolute must-see, particularly during the vibrant summer months. If you find yourself in Schwerin, I highly recommend allocating time to explore this remarkable destination."
Schwerin Castle,Yuliya Teteryuk,5,"This castle is incredibly beautiful. I especially liked the impressive territory - a lot of greenery, flowers and amazing trees. I highly recommend visiting this piece of art."
Schwerin Castle,Chhandosee Bhattacharya,4,"Beautiful castle with lovely gardens. Tickets 8.50 euros. Musicians playing near the gate which adds to the ambience. A lot of people's appeared in traditional clothes. Some fest is going on at this time, lots of food stalls, activities for kids etc. Boat rides available on the lake."
Castle Campbell,JA Baby,5,"There are two car parks. The lower car park is bigger, the upper car park has 16 spaces and can be busy. The walk is shorter from the upper car park (around 5/10mins). It's a lovely castle with a very well kept tower with amazing views of Dollar Glen from the top. There are a few walks around the glen too, and if brave you can have a dip in the burn."
Castle Campbell,Peter Campbell,5,Great historic building surrounded by stunning scenery. We’ll worth climbing the tower to get a look at the view.
Castle Campbell,Sandy Culpepper,5,"This is a very nice castle ruins to visit. You can enter, and there are some great views when you reach the top. When purchasing our tickets, we were greeted by two staffers. Both were happy to talk and to give you the history of the castle. Well worth the visit"
Castle Campbell,Chapelle Crescent,5,Beautifully renovated in some parts! Stunning scenery with dramatic views!!! 😁 360 degree view on the top 👌
Castle Campbell,Allan Boyd,5,"Great little castle to visit if you are in the area. Enough for kids to take in, be excited about, and learn, and not too much that they’ll end up tired and grumpy. Lovely gardens at the front for a little picnic or to play hide and seek afterwards. Bathroom & a mini gift shop."
Castello di Venere,Fahri Asgarzade,5,A great castle in a medieval town of Erice with breathtaking sea view. At the time of the visit the castle was temporarily closed for works. There is a nice cafe next to a panoramic view.
Castello di Venere,Wanderlust Nomad,5,Visiting Castello di Venere is a must do thing when you are in Trapani or even in Palermo. It’s definitely worth visiting. Erice has a different air and a different experience the architecture and the streets allow you to via time. Also I recommend taking a cable car to Trapani for 6€ if you are in Erice.
Castello di Venere,Gregg Vertes,5,Absolutely fantastic views! Lots of space to walk around and many seating and viewing areas. 1000% worth the visit as the views are spectacular. There are lots of restaurants and hotels around the area open in the summer months. The castle itself is basically built on the side of a cliff. Pretty amazing.
Castello di Venere,Emanuela Reil,5,"Beautiful, amazing place to visit. Ewentualnie though it's temporary closed, you have to see this place."
Castello di Venere,Jan Bieron,5,"The ruined temple/castle makes has a majestic, eerie feeling and provides with a stunning panoramic view from inside on both north and west coast. If you're someone who likes to read about places you visit, you will find some boards with history texts, but take note that some of them are misplaced or duplicated. Entry only with a ticket but worth in my opinion. A must-see if you're visiting Erice."
Golubac,Ljiljana Đukić,5,"The Golubac fortress is located near the Golubac settlement on the right bank of the Danube. It is located at the very entrance to the Đerdap Gorge on high inaccessible cliffs and belongs to the Đerdap National Park. The fortress in its impressive enclosure has 3 parts - the front, back and upper town with 10 towers and two large gates. The towers are connected to each other by ramparts so that they can defend the city from both the river and the land. The city was entered via a bridge that was built over a large moat filled with water. The fortress was built on the remains of an old Roman fortification, but it is not known exactly what year it is and who was its creator. Many battles were fought around this magnificent fortress and various peoples marched along the centuries-old ramparts. The fortress was in the hands of the Ottomans and then the Hungarians for a long time until it was finally handed over to the Serbian prince Mihail Obrenović in 1867. Today, the fortress has been reconstructed and looks beautiful at the place where the Danube is the widest and resembles the sea. In the palace of the Golubac fortress, visitors can see the archaeological exhibition War equipment and weapons of the Golubac fortress, then on the first floor a phototype edition of Miroslav's Gospel. In July, an exhibition was opened under the name ""Frescoes of the Virgin of Ljeviška and fabrics inspired by Serbian medieval ornaments. Another exhibition is very significant and that is ""Knights of the Dove Fortress"" which tells the story of the famous Order of the Dragon - one of the medieval knightly orders. Something that I the most interesting is the medieval Shajka that sailed in front of the fortress.Soon visitors will be able to ride around the walls and enjoy the view of the fortress from the Danube."
Golubac,Bogdan Jovanovic,5,"Excellently decorated place, full of history and interesting stories.. Definitely worth a visit! If you want to climb the highest tower, you must have hiking boots, otherwise they won't let you in because it's very steep and climb at your own risk, but it's worth going up there.."
Linderhof Palace,Shamima Akhter Shanchi,5,Such a Beautiful place. In summer the palace looks spectacular. From April to October you can take a visit inside the Castle and the tickets are only 10 euro per person. It’s amazing inside the king residence. There are very good English speaking tour guides who can explain very nicely to the non-german speaker visitors. The whole palace area is so peaceful and well maintained. You can just sit and relax under a tree. It’s also looks beautiful in winter specially with snow. But I would recommend you to visit is summer. It looks more lively in Summer.
Linderhof Palace,Sorrelle Welch,4,"Lovely place. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but it was a great tour inside. The rooms are well worth a look, there's lots of delicate and old ornaments to admire. The staff are friendly and informative. You can't take pictures inside, so enjoy the tour while it lasts. The gardens surrounding the Palace are lovely and definitely worth having a wander around while you're waiting for your tour time."
Linderhof Palace,Jennifer Weinstein,4,The palace is surprisingly small but the grounds are beautiful and the eccentricity of the Prince really comes through in the artifacts that are kept and explained. But keep in mind it's a pretty good walk from the parking lot up to the palace and then again to the mini palace with the peacocks which was so cool!!  The Prince tried to emulate Louis XIV so it was cool to see the similarities.
Linderhof Palace,Ілона Бабкіна,5,"One of the most beautiful places in Germany! Not big, but stunning castle with sculptures, fountains and landscaping design! Mountains around looks great! But for the cold season, statues are closed to keep from destruction, so I recommend to visit Linderhof Palace in summer to see maximum"
Linderhof Palace,David S,5,"Very friendly staff who do excellent tours of the interior of the palace in excellent English. No photography inside the building,but lots of pictures can be taken of the exterior and the amazing gardens. Great facilities such as cafe shop and plenty of toilets! A hidden gem well worth a visit."
Domaine du Château de Modave,Jordan Karamalakov,5,"An interesting place, unusual for Belgium. Very well maintained. All this was an impressive visit, to see the complex of buildings, gardens and amazing interior. I would recommend to visit such place no matter it Isa little remote."
Domaine du Château de Modave,Alain Herbertz,5,"We visited the castle during the summer, and with was really great. Now with the additional Christmas lighting and atmosphere it's an exceptional visit."
Domaine du Château de Modave,Ulan Garba Matta,5,"The grounds alone are enchanting. While there is no open access to the Château, the beauty around it is worth the visit."
Domaine du Château de Modave,Adriana Ilie,5,Visited 2 years ago and it was amazing. Unfortunately you can't make reservations unless you book the whole property.
Domaine du Château de Modave,D T,1,No service pathetic! Waited an hour to get into our room after making a reservation. Off to a really bad start seems Ibis may be a better alternative.
Lichtenstein Castle,Jaren Rogers,5,Beautiful castle to walk around and view the amazing views. Not the largest castle and we weren't able to go inside but very picturesque nonetheless.
Lichtenstein Castle,Fabiola Falsetti,3,"Beautiful view, as shown in the pictures. The castle is fairly small, it turns out it can't be visited in its entirety, except on Fridays. However, on the brochure they provide when you purchase the ticket, it says that tower & second floor are not open to public because they're not secure. Anyway, I would have loved to visit the whole thing but it was a Tuesday so I had to settle for great view, great pictures, fresh hair."
Lichtenstein Castle,Adrien Pierret,5,Beautiful castle and scenery. Perfect for a nice picture of the valley and a bit of relaxation in the surrounding park. Not much to see but worth going for the view alone.
Lichtenstein Castle,Ilsa Jakob,4,"Really beautiful mini fairytale castle. Well worth a visit and only 12 euro for entry with a guided tour. Only 4 euro with no tour, but then you can't go inside the castle. Tour is conducted in german, but you are given a little guide book in your chosen language. Tour lasts around 25mins. No need to pre book, we arrived at 12 and got the 12:40 tour, which gave time to take some pictures and enjoy the wonderful location.  The views from the courtyard are breathtaking. Great photo opportunities."
Lichtenstein Castle,Joy BCN,4,"Great experience, lovely castel and admission is very affordable. 4 euros adults and 2 children just for the courtyard, and the guided tour is 12 euros for adults. Dogs are welcome in the courtyard and the guided tour if you can hold them in your arms for about 30 min."
Kreuzenstein Castle,Pontus Thedvall,3,"Kreuzenstein Castle is beautiful and a definite ""must see"". Every top of the hour they have tours but tragically only in German, but I was notified until after I purchased the ticket and the tour had started. In addition, no pictures were allowed inside the castle, other than in the courtyard.  To conclude, I was greatly disappointed that I did not experience the tour per my expectation as I did not understand the guide, nor did I get the chance to capture architectural shots from inside the castle.  Because of the conditions were not communicated prior to purchasing the ticket, I only gave castle Kreuzenstein three stars.  On the side note, there's enough parking for an entire garrison and the restaurant, located outside the castle provided good quality dishes.  Overall, I do recommend a visit but understand that the entrance fee (guided tour) will not give you the value you expect if you do not understand German or if you are interested in capturing pictures (historical / architectural) inside the castle."
Kreuzenstein Castle,Magdalena Reszke,4,"Guided tours and in German only. Be sure to wait at the gate 5-10 minutes prior to the tour, you will buy tickets behind the gate. You can ask for a short summary in English printed on A4. You will see only the kitchen, armoury, dining and sleeping room. The tour takes 30 minutes and costs 15€."
Kreuzenstein Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"The castle is like a fairy tale! This is a must-see point when you are in Vienna. The castle is very interesting inside, the kitchen, the armory, and the knight's hall, but you almost will not find any picture because it is prohibited to make photos inside. You can make pictures in the castle yard. It is free parking near the castle. Entrance to the castle is only with a guide tours and only in German. For other languages, they provide some  short information on A4. Please request when buying a ticket. The entrance fee is 15 euros, and tours will take place every hour and will continue apprx 45-50 min"
Kreuzenstein Castle,midoriguchi,3,"Tourist rip off alert. Expensive ticket (EUR 15 per head) -for this price you get a short and quite useless guided tour in German. No English tours available. The castle is cute on the outside, but the inside is not authentic, it's a mish-mash of random objects from all over the world. It's clear that the owner turned it into a 'museum' to make a profit. You get rushed around inside. Photos not allowed but the tour guide didn't stop anyone from taking plenty of pictures, so at least that's a plus."
Kreuzenstein Castle,Paulina,4,Kreuzenstein is an interesting castle to visit.  Situated an hour drive from Vienna it makes a nice day tour destination for those who appreciate medieval architecture.  The castle was badly damaged during the WW2 air raids. However the owners restored it the best they could by importing stone and masonry from all over Europe.  Most impressive were the castle kitchens which housed a contraption designed by daVinci.  The armory room housed a great collection of medieval weaponry.   Right across from the castle is a tavern where you can treat yourself to authentic food and great local beer.
Vinotéka v zámecké bráně,Růžena Šejhlová,5,"A small, pleasant wine shop in the heart of Valtice. The owner is a great guy, friendly, if you're interested he'll be happy to chat about wine and life, he has plenty of wine so if you have a few hours to spare, be sure to stop by and you won't regret it. It can be seen that the gentleman does it not only for money, but also for the warm love of wine. We left long after closing with the feeling of a pleasantly spent evening, we will definitely come back 👍 For me, a much better experience than the entire underground, if you like a personal approach, don't hesitate."
Vinotéka v zámecké bráně,Ivan Knézel,5,"One of the best wine shops we have come across is located in the beautiful surroundings of the Valtice Castle, very nicely furnished and equipped, with a diverse range of wine for tasting and pleasant service."
Vinotéka v zámecké bráně,Petra Míková,2,"In the heat of the 4th of June, to serve unchilled wines and to make excuses about the fact that the refrigerator will not be turned on until a week from now is perhaps not even believable today. And the toilet was out of order. I don't recommend it for that reason."
Vinotéka v zámecké bráně,Lin Rin,5,"A very pleasant, stylish place with friendly service and a wide selection of excellent wines."
Vinotéka v zámecké bráně,Olda Štěrba,1,"Unfortunately, I have to advise against it.. closed during opening hours and when I asked the operator by phone, I was told that if no one is there, it will be closed.. An unconventional approach"
Hohenzollern Castle,Elizabeth Scheuer-Murphy,5,You buy your tickets down below and then there is a bus that can take you up there and it will bring you back. You can walk up there but it's like a half an hour to 45 minute hike up and back. I do let you in at a time stamp on your ticket so it's not overcrowded inside you download an app that walks you through the audio guide of the castle. Kind of interesting because you can go back if you want and listen to something else you can stop it. Quite unique and the castle is very interesting. There is a cafe and the premises where you can have lunch or dinner. There's an ice cream stand
Hohenzollern Castle,Billie Ceridwen Circles,4,Lovely views with great staff and some nice exhibits. Loved all the stained glass windows and cold doors. Too bad some of the exhibits are not quite down yet but that’s why it’s worth visiting - it supports a lovely piece of history
Hohenzollern Castle,Gandalf,5,"Very pretty place. Parking is done like 2km before the castle and you take the bus to get up. When you have arrived and checked in you are free to walk around the castles exterior and to some extent, the interior and the treasury."
Hohenzollern Castle,Angela M,5,"Be prepared for a lot of stairs at a steep incline. There is a shuttle bus, but it fills up. Parking was easy. Purchase tickets ahead of time online. Plenty of food, drink and ice cream options. Beautiful view."
Hohenzollern Castle,Monica Melinda Mera,5,"Now this is a proper castle! Very beautiful, really impressive views. Worth the money! Restaurant on site is a little bit pricey (not a surprise) but food and drinks were alright."
Château de Chantilly,Marc Zaks,5,We stopped at the castle on the drive to Amsterdam from Brussels. The castle is great for all ages. Beautiful gardens and the castle is a work of art. You can spend hours in and outside the castle.
Château de Chantilly,Martina D,5,Beautiful palace in a very quaint town. Worth the stroll through the gardens and inside the palace. The amount of art work and other details is stunning in this surprise stop for us. The library offers some amazing 1st editions dating back to the 1400’s. The gardens are well maintained and are enjoyable to walk around (if not closed for filming or other artistic work). The palace is near the horse track and easy to navigate. Great place to escape from bustle of Paris.
Château de Chantilly,Sarah Roberts,5,"I was told it's a place to go to get away from the crowds of Paris. We just happened to choose the day when Real Madrid were in town, and so were hundreds of other people. It's a short ride on a fast train and worth it."
Château de Chantilly,Don Vito,5,"It's a marvellous place, impressive Chateau and very interesting gardens around it. We weren't unsure but walking a parcour around it (2,5 h). Very nice!"
Château de Chantilly,Daniela Horsley,5,"Fabulous castle and gardens. You need a few hours and good weather to see everything. Make sure to reserve a table or bring food with you as there are no options in short walking distance besides the castle’s two restaurants. Entrance costs 17 euros full price, parking costs 5 euros. You can go in and out the Castle/grounds with your ticket during the day but this does not apply to the parking which is a few hundred meters from the entrance(s)."
Château de Chambord,Alexandra-Gabriela Comandasu,5,"Whilst the place was being restored was still a good idea. On the inside, the château has a lot to offer to visitors and outside, the estate is grand! We choose to visit the outside with an electric golf cart (I must add, I love how French people are all about sustainability, all their chateaux have tables instead of paper fliers and maps ♥️). I definitely recommend a trip with the golf cart, is cheap and you get some extraordinary pictures, plus, is fun if you have kids. There were a few food and drink stands outside, so I’m case you get distracted and absorbed by the treasures this place have to offer, you are covered for food, drinks and snacks. Cannot wait to return and see it after the restoration is finished."
Château de Chambord,Pom V.,5,The castle is bigger than I think. It is really beautiful start from outside mostly is the roof of the castle.  Inside rooms are good decoration with good presentation. Recommend to take tablet for more information and see the old photo in the same time.
Château de Chambord,AndyundSarah,5,"First visit on a Saturday. Not as crowded as expected. Still enough free parking lots. We did not find an e-car charging station. If you are disabled with a cars, you can enter for free and your accompanying person as well. Even parking will be free. This is outstanding! The castle ist amazing, the gardens wide and well to access. You can rent a golf caddy or a boat. There are some local vendors on a market styled place offering their crafted foods and drinks. We did not like the current art exhibition, but tastes are different. The collection of oil paintings is superb."
Château de Chambord,luca scarma,5,"This castle is absolutely fantastic! Been on my bucket list for ages, and luckily had the chance to visit it. The architecture of the castle itself is just awesome, plus you have the chance to check one of Leonardo Da Vinci’s latest project! Personally a once in a lifetime kind of experience!"
Château de Chambord,Eliana “EllieMann” Mann,5,"Beautiful place to visit, the biggest château in the Loire Valle. Book online to avoid the queues.The interactive iPads are excellent. Parking is paid for in the machines and is not expensive. The Cafe is good but don’t leave it for to late as they run out of the baguette deal for €12.00. Gardens are pretty but not the best I have seen. Nevertheless a very interesting place. I would recommend this to my close friends."
Château d'If,expatmum 2,5,"Beautiful place to visit away from the hustle and bustle of Marseille.  Interesting history,  well explained in the castle.  There is a restaurant and toilets and fabulous views and peace.  We absolutely loved our day out here and unexpectedly spent 4 hours there! Great value for money."
Château d'If,Xi Me,5,"As many people said, very special experience, especially for my little boy, he is in the stage of being interested in castles, knights, war, this military fort has inspired him a lot of ideas and has further  Learn about its historical interest."
Château d'If,Raj P,5,"This is one of the must see places in Marseilles, especially if you are a Alexander Dumas fan. Even otherwise, the boat ride up to the château from the old port of Marseilles is about 20 mins each way, the views are absolutely spectacular, both of the old port and the chateau and the city seen from the sea! Make sure you take the boat ride giving yourself enough time if you wanted to get off and then make it back before the last boat ride back from the château. You can catch spectacular views clear up to the Notre-Dame de la Garde from the ride to or back from the château. If your are pressed on time, you also have the option of just the boat ride around the château and back without getting off at the château. Definitely worth it and quite enjoyable especially on a sunny afternoon or evening."
Château d'If,Federico Navarro,5,Great place! A reference for those who read The Count of Monte Cristo. Great castle that served as a defense for the city and later as a prison.
Château d'If,Brendan McIntyre,4,"Pretty fun but 1 hour was not enough time. Lots of great views from the castle and good picture opportunities. Well worth a visit for history buffs, for sure."
Hotel Monteriggioni,Kylie Hughes,5,"Five stars for location!!! When else do you get to stay inside the walls of a 13th Century walled village?? We made the mistake of parking in the tourist car park and dragging our bags to the door. Please know that you can drive through the front arch of the town and park in a private area inside the walls. Buying a ticket to climb up to the top of the wall is a must and the small museum (included in ticket) is worth a brief visit. The hotel itself is simple but very comfortable, with a lovely breakfast."
Hotel Monteriggioni,laura nardi,1,They charged me 100 pound for an additional person with a single bed. They made me paying cash. They do not accept card for extra expenses. Expensive and greedy. No costumer service. The swimming pool is tiny compared to the photos in the website. not recommended.
Hotel Monteriggioni,Georgy Ostapishin,5,"Stayed here with my wife on our honeymoon. This hotel is an absolute gem of Tuscany. The hotel, staff, and location are absolutely fantastic! Francesco, Francesca and Eric are phenomenal hosts who went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was perfect.  Overall, an absolutely incredible and unforgettable experience. Would certainly recommend and we will definitely be back!"
Hotel Monteriggioni,sanyisa,5,"Amazing place to stay! If you are searching for a calm place where you won’t be overwhelmed by crowd, this is the place for you. It is managed by a lovely friendly family that made us feel special. Rooms and all the areas are obviously very clean, including the pool side. This hotel is obviously managed by the staff that knows how to do their job. We even relied on them when it came to a choice of restaurant. They suggested a very nice restaurant just next to the hotel with a great service and delicious food and nice spacious outdoor area."
Hotel Monteriggioni,Fidlschuster Julia Anna,1,Beware of fraud! No recognition of the voucher by the company: We wanted to stay at the Romantikhotel 1 night in April 2020 and were unable to travel to Italy due to Corona. We got an unlimited voucher. Now we wanted to redeem the voucher (180 euros) in April 2022 but the new management (but the same hotel name) does not recognize the voucher although the European consumer center says that this voucher is valid!!!! The hotel no longer responds to emails either!
Rocca Calascio,Giuseppe Onorato,5,"It's an amazing place. The hilltop commands stunning views on the surrounding hills and you can see the high peaks of Gran Sasso in the distance. Both times I went the sunset was amazing, with the red disk sinking over the mountains and casting shades of orange on the castle and the surroundings. I went up to the village just prior the castle with the car at 19:10, around the end of August."
Rocca Calascio,Shmuel Barber,5,"Stunning scenery and definitely worth the effort. You can walk up the road to the top from a small village which takes about 40 mins, or you can cycle or drive up. Once up the top, you can continue walking along the mountain ridges or rest and take in the views. It wasn't too busy when I went, but that was a weekday, so I presume weekends will be rammed."
Rocca Calascio,Harald Harms,5,"Very stunning castle ruin ,even the drive up the mountain was incredible. You can't drive right up to the castle, you either have to walk the 4 kms to it or take a bus from the village below. It costs 4 euros roundtrip per person. Some of the paths around the ruins might be a bit tricky for some people. The old Borgo close to the castle has several places to eat or have a drink plus some gift type shops."
Rocca Calascio,Michal Schindler,5,"Great place and great views from top to the surrounding countryside. No ticket needed. Therr is shuttle bus from parming down in toen, or could better walk and do something for your wellbeing :-)"
Rocca Calascio,Maks Krivesko,5,Ruins of an ancient castle on top of a mountain with spectacular views over the surrounding mountain ranges and nearby villagea.
La vie de chateau,Johan V.S.,5,"Fantastic stay in the heart of Grignan, close to everything and super quiet.  Had amazing sleeps here.  As comfortable as it gets. Véronique is the perfect host.  Responsive when needed and never intrusive.  Gives good advice.  Always a smile.  I hope the new owners will do it as she does."
La vie de chateau,Anton Thiebault,5,Wonderful
La vie de chateau,Krystal Klean Express Limited,5,Nice
La vie de chateau,Karine Di Nacéra,5,"Magic of the place at the gates of the Château de Grignan. Véronique is very welcoming, the breakfast is a delight and the decoration of the house is refined. An idyllic place where you feel good."
La vie de chateau,Marylene GARET,5,"Excellent welcome from the hostess Véronique Robert, a 16th century house a few meters from the castle in a street a few steps from the heart of the city. Excellently decorated house, located on 2 levels, we were pleased to have reserved one night for our stopover in Grignan and we highly recommend this residence of character. Thanks to Véronique for her welcome, her availability and her advice. very good season"
Gołuchów Castle,Tatiana Kojar,5,"Loved this place, specially the park. Spent around 4 hours there, and it was not enough. Fantastic old trees, terrific views, birds singing, rare animals - everything is so peaceful and picturesque. Definitely worth coming here again and again!"
Gołuchów Castle,Louati Aymen,5,"Goluchow Castle in Poland Gołuchów Castle is a real gem in Poland that you must visit. The castle and park complex in Goluchow is today considered the most beautiful in Poland. Around 1560, the defense yard was built by Duke Rafał Leszczyński. Then his son Wacław turned the building into a magnate's residence. The most significant events in the history of the castle took place in the 19th century. In 1853 Tytus Dzialynski (owner of the castle in Kornik) bought the castle for his only son Jan. Not long after, Jan Działyński married Izabella, daughter of Prince Adam Czartoryski, leader of the Hotel Lambert faction. Izabella transformed the residence into a chateau in the style of the French Renaissance (a wealth of details). She brought artists from there: architects, sculptors and painters."
Gołuchów Castle,Martin Fox,5,Very nice place in the middle of the Poland
Gołuchów Castle,Glenn Standish,4,"A beautiful place in outstanding grounds. However, the entrance procedure is currently a real hassle. Yes, I understand that they are not letting any more than 10 people in at a time due to Covid. But to expect us to wait for an hour outside is unacceptable. They should introduce an online ticketing system. As it is we completely wasted unnecessary time waiting and as a result our plans for the rest of the day were ruined. Still it's worth a visit.  They just need to improve their ticketing system...and hopefully after reading this, they will."
Gołuchów Castle,Sarah Marques,5,"I was there in the winter, so was everything white, because of the snow. I'm from Brazil, so in Poland was my first time seeing the snow like that, for me was really special and beauty. Of course was cold, but was so interesting see the typical Poland's animals, the castles, that I forgot about the cold hahahaha. I really loved this place and recommend for everyone."
Château de Fontainebleau,DAIN JUNG,5,"Although we didn’t purchase tickets to enter the castle, just exploring the garden was also very nice. Every photograph I captured in this place looks like those scenes from postcards."
Château de Fontainebleau,John Simons,5,"Lovely chateau, spectacular entrance. Rooms were beautifully decorated.  The audio guide was very informative, a lot of Napoleon history. Lovely gardens."
Château de Fontainebleau,Adolfo Roman,4,Little Versailles some would say. This  chateau is a great introduction to the French nobility lifestyle. Really nice castle with a big terrace and garden. Very close by the parking spots and accessible via the city entrances. Must see.
Château de Fontainebleau,Grant Donnelly,5,"Gorgeous grounds to wander and no wait on a weekday. Huge fish in the lake and many of them! Love the architecture, the grounds are peaceful and there is no walking on the grass."
Château de Fontainebleau,Jason Sager,5,"I've been before many years ago and it still is as impressive as ever. In fact, I think it is better than Versailles. No where as many tourists which lets you take your time and the gardens are just as impressive as those at Versailles."
Dunluce Castle,Jakob,5,"Do you love castles? Game of Thrones even? You probably want to give this castle a look, with a beautiful outlook and historical significance. This is a beautiful castle. It was used as a filming set for the game of thrones, not internally just externally as they were not allowed to film inside. The castle provided the base for the CGI. Though it's a wonderful castle and we'll worth the wander."
Dunluce Castle,Robin Curry,5,"This is a very beautiful remnant of a castle. If you visit, be sure to walk down the path and around the structure. The views are incredible! There is also a small visitor space that is worth a look and where you can learn more of the history of the castle."
Dunluce Castle,Aga Daly,5,"Most amazing castle in Ireland. Well looked after and preserved. Really enjoyed archery. Lovely visitors centre where you can try on olden days clothes n play archeologiest, nice small gift shop. Breath taking views. You can claimb the tower. We enjoyed exploring every nook of this place."
Dunluce Castle,tom browning,5,Small visitors room which is interactive for the kids.  The castle is large enough to explore.  It really is the views that make it.  The views are fantastic.  There are toilets and friendly staff.  The whole place feels well run and well loved.  Defo worth the visit.
Dunluce Castle,Matt Crockard,5,Beautiful place ..people from all walks of life and from around the world visit ..good set up ..with guided  tours ..not far to walk ..but maybe a challenge to those who cant walk to good .as thers a couple of steep but short hilly bits .. The history is amazing ..and the story intriguing
Kalmar Castle,Björn Andersson,5,Really good exhibition of the Swedish Kings. Perfect for kids. The cost starts after the shop. So feel free to look around on the wall surrounding the castle. Inside was the most impressive digital Monet exhibition.  Definitely recommend to go there.
Kalmar Castle,Julian Modro,5,Very much recommended! At the day we visit… today… there were many cool activities for kids of various ages! The Monet & Friends visual experience is also a nice thing going on during August/23.
Kalmar Castle,Ge Pe,5,"Very nice castle. Nice tour, also in english. A lot of kids animation, there are people dressed in original clothes and knight fights in a small arena. A visit will take about 2 hours, maybe more if you want..."
Kalmar Castle,Ingridele Ardaviciene,5,"A very nice big castle, lots of things on display, lots of entertainment. Interesting for both children and adults. You can take a walk with your dog."
Kalmar Castle,Vittoria Voroshilova,5,Very interesting place with a lot of history and beauty. Good English guided tours included in admission tickets. Recommend to visit this castle.
Quinta da Regaleira,Maggie Kiara,5,"Beautiful castle. I'd highly recommend going inside and taking in the view from the balconies. You can see the rest of the palace grounds as well as the city from up on the terraces. Of course, there's a short wait to get in and the exterior may be the most impressive part, but if you have the time, I still think it's worth it to go inside and admire the architecture up close. The interior is lovely as well."
Quinta da Regaleira,Justin Son,5,"What a stunning place! This is one of the most unique places I have ever seen. The initial well is an experience and the palace is gorgeous. My only complaint is that going during the summer (late august) is not only hot, but insanely crowded, so be prepared to wait."
Quinta da Regaleira,Giulio Cambruzzi,5,"Very nice place, recommended to buy your tickets in advance (high season). There's a huge line to see the staircase (40 min + of waiting). Go early and take your time there, you also have other castles near to visit so you can use the morning for one and then see another in the afternoon."
Quinta da Regaleira,Hilda Timea Pato,5,"Make sure you buy tickets in advance, unless you don t want to waste like 40 minutes. I would advise to plan for 2.5 (up to 3 hours) for the palace and the garden. There were 2 ling queues inside: one to the palace and one to the initiation well."
Quinta da Regaleira,Terra Scott,5,"This was the best place to visit in Sintra! Definitely go to the well first, as that gets a long line during the day! And don’t just go to the well  and the castle definitely go to the gardens where there’s a labyrinth and a grotto that’s fun to explore. There’s also a church, a fountain, another hidden well, Greek statues, and all sorts of things to find. This was definitely my favorite out of my whole Portugal trip! So do not miss this spot! Plus, the people at this location were really nice and helpful! Unlike some of the other places in Sintra!  Such a Cole Castle! It reminds me of the Addams family for some reason… also look at all of the statues. Some are gargoyles that look like they’re eating themselves. Interesting."
"Kafe ""Mariya"", Yalta",Илья Олов,5,"Very tasty, and most importantly, home cooking. Everything is done at the time of order and everything is hot. They took lamb shish kebab, it is very tasty, and most importantly, there is no fat. The hodgepodge is very good, I wanted meat, but 3 types of sausages are excellent and they also put lemon.  Roast at home with it carefully: it's delicious, but if you don't like fatty foods, it's better to take something else. Soup Noodles is very fragrant and appetizing. Diana worked with us. Smart, attentive, polite girl. Good luck and keep up the good work!"
"Kafe ""Mariya"", Yalta",Татьяна Андриянова,5,"Delicious! Portions are huge!!! Beautiful serving of dishes)) The prices are reasonable) The husband is full, the child is satisfied😊"
"Kafe ""Mariya"", Yalta",Alexandr B,5,"Nice view, friendly staff, delicious food. Fast service. Was, however, out of season - in December."
"Kafe ""Mariya"", Yalta",Дмитрий Ляхов,1,"Bad place. Extremely dissatisfied. He brought okroshka from some kind of sitra. Tea from the water is incomprehensible, sea perhaps. You don't need to go here."
"Kafe ""Mariya"", Yalta",Владимир Авдеев,4,"Normal cafe with a normal menu. There is a trick that is common for passing places: weight portions are served a little more, not 200 grams, but 300, for example, which increases the score. The waiter girl isn't the friendliest, but everyone has bad days. They accept cards. For a dinner for three: fish soup, lamb shish kebab, red mullet, rapani, village potatoes (peasant style), a kettle of tea - I paid 1,900 rubles. There are no questions about the quality of food and cooking. The open part of the cafe is replete with cats of different colors and sizes."
National Palace of Pena,Jz L,4,"restored, given new coat of shell to bring out magnificent interior of collections. Got to prepare more time like an hour to get to the top (entrance) because roads can be jammed on peak days. If less crowds, it’s a great place to feel the breeze and enjoy panoramic scenes."
National Palace of Pena,Theresa Hoban,5,Buy your tickets in advance and get a time slot for early in the day. It is a fantastic experience climbing up the road and then going through all the parts of the Palace. Give yourselves lots of time because you can easily make a day of it. We had a great time and our entire day was amazing.
National Palace of Pena,Terra Scott,4,"This is an absolute must see when in Sintra Portugal and Lisbon Portugal.   Just 45 minutes away by train from Lisbon it’s like visiting the Disney castle!   Get tickets in advance and group them with the Moorish Castle which is basically next door.  The building/castle is the best part.  Colors look awesome and the views are great!  Just don’t wander around in the park too long… you might get lost like we did and we were not prepared to hike that long in dresses and sandals.   Wear hiking shoes!  So many hills.  Stay on the WIDE paths. That’s my advice.  And just skip the park and go straight to the castle, because when you exit the castle you could go through the gardens anyway on the way to Moorish castle…"
National Palace of Pena,margo torres,5,"this is officially the most beautiful castle I have been in Europe. The history is interesting, the decoration is beautiful, colors amazing and the views outstanding. You need to buy the ticket choosing the timeslot of when you'll enter the castle. I would recommend you to eat outside and bring maybe your own snacks because there's nothing to eat around and the 'restaurants' inside the complex are terrible and very few options. The walk around the gardens is gorgeous. Highly recommend this place"
National Palace of Pena,Myriam Jab,5,"Very pretty castle. I recommend to go as early as you can, very crowdy. If your ticket is at 2pm. It’s for the entrance to the castle, you can still come earlier to hang out in the gardens and take your time to reach the castle. It’s a small walk of 10minutes but pretty steep."
Park and Palace of Monserrate,Rod T.,5,"The grounds around the palace are wonderful. The variety of trees and other plants is impressive, and the atmosphere (except when you find yourself near the loud citizens of a certain neighboring country) is relaxing. My only complaint would be the condition of the rose garden, although that is easily explained by the need to save water during the summer."
Park and Palace of Monserrate,Alessandro Balocco,5,"It is really a great place to visit in Sintra! The whole site including the park is such a quaint and relaxing place. When we arrived we bought the tickets at the entrance and there was no queue.  The style of the palace is very unique and it is interesting to read the story of the various owners. After visiting the palace we spent time wandering around the gardens, it is literally a botanical garden with many different types of areas. Everything is so well taken care of.  The ruin in the park was also something I was not expecting and loved to see.  Sintra is a fantastic place and there are many things to visit but I definitely recommend this one if you have enough time!"
Park and Palace of Monserrate,S L,5,Much more quiet than the other castles in Sintra but we'll worth a visit. Still absolutely stunning carvings and a lovely garden park. You can walk back to Sintra at least one way and it's a nice 2km stretch
Park and Palace of Monserrate,Benedict Jones,5,"Very lovely palace with beautiful gardens, and not too busy (slightly quieter as you can't easily walk from Sintra). Be prepared to walk up and down a hill, although there is a small 'bus' which can take you down to the palace."
Park and Palace of Monserrate,Kimia G,4,"A personal art project of a rich art collector Englishman. Beautiful carvings inside and good information of the history. The gardens are even more beautiful, with probably hundreds of plant species, trees arranged in a way which makes you feel like you're in paradise.  Take time to relax and enjoy the gardens, although keep well covered as there are ants that bite on the lawn. The cafe had the nicest (and sourest) lemon slushie, as well as a variety of cakes and sandwiches. Bathrooms were clean. Hop on hop off bus available although the park isn't as big as Pena."
Hever Castle & Gardens,Nicola Gibbs,5,"Fantastic day, such a lovely place, everyone was friendly. The castle is small, but this makes it great if you have younger children. Gardens a beautiful. The water maze was fun. Also we saw the falconry display which was funny and informative. Wish we had got there early as we still had more to see. Downside is all the food places close about an hour before the place closes, we needed a quick tea/drink before leaving, could do with them closing 30 mins before. Overall 5*"
Hever Castle & Gardens,Ana,5,"It was a wonderful day at Hever Castle! Worth visiting. All the staffs were friendly and helpful! The only downside if you don’t have a car, no  taxi nor bus from Hever Station. If you love walking, there’s an adventure footpath along the farm, which you will walk pass lovely Horses and flocks of sheep. Otherwise, whole experience was great!"
Hever Castle & Gardens,Leila Mendes,5,"First visit to Hever Castle and we just paid for the gardens. There's just so much to do outside of the castle that I think we'll go inside for our next visit.  Lots of parking and kiosks for coffee/teas, drinks ice creams etc. We visited on a day where we could watch the horse jousting, which was great fun!  The playgrounds are decent. A giant replica castle for the little people to run around and a smaller sand based playground for the littler people!  Would absolutely visit again.  It's beautiful and lots to keep the children happy and busy from feeding the ducks, the playgrounds, great shows and highly recommend the water maze (bring a change of clothes or/and a towel!) Great day!"
Hever Castle & Gardens,Ankur Palmia,4,The garden is great and you can easily spend around 2 hours here. You would enjoy the castle only if you are interested in British history. Parking was free. *Buy tickets online to get some discount.
Hever Castle & Gardens,Craig Higginson,5,"Great day out. Been here before but not during the jousting competitions. Great experience and they involve the kids so it's fairly family friendly. Would recommend a walk around the gardens and the castle (even though the castle itself is quite small). A lot more food options than last time I went, and the gift shop is pretty decent. Very tidy overall and very helpful staff."
Hampton Court Palace,Charlene Nelson,5,"One of my favourite places to visit, everyone always has a great time.  The Palace is stunning, the history is interesting and the gardens beautiful. It is a perfect day out for all ages and there's always something new to discover!"
Hampton Court Palace,Jason Cates,5,"I love this place , with a fascination of Henry VIII from my history teacher way back in 1985. Gorgeous gardens , palace and even more stunning is the Horses a special bread. It also ignited a love for dahlias and I know have many varieties. Lovely place to visit and will return."
Hampton Court Palace,Christie,5,"I attended the recent Jousting event and even though it was a very rainy day it did not dampen the atmosphere! Everyone involved were wonderful & it was clear they all really put a lot of effort into organising this! I have visited the Palace several times and even used to live next door at the neighbouring King's Arms Hotel (many years ago!) So I have a special place in my heart for the area. Will definitely return soon, I'm sure 🤗"
Hampton Court Palace,L A,5,"What a wonderful day. It’s huge, beautifully kept, full of history and amazing atmosphere. Great for kids too with the magic garden, slides, sand and water features to play with. The gardens alone are just so beautiful and huge! So many staff and plenty of them. The best customer service I’ve ever had from all of them. Huge toilets with plenty of cubicles.  I do think £3.79 for a soft drink is steep. A ice cream was £4. Especially when tickets are £29.  Car park is always full on peak days. We sometimes catch the Turks boat from Richmond there and back.  Overall a magical place. The upkeep of the palace is amazing. So atmospheric and full of history."
Hampton Court Palace,Hannah Smith,4,Beautiful palace and gardens. Interesting historical information and plenty to see and do whilst visiting. There are several place to buy food and drinks throughout the palace however it is all quite expensive. Can get very busy as there are often school trips visiting during the week. Spacious car parks and additional parking is usually available during the larger events.
Rozafa Castle,Jurgen Caka,5,"Amazing view. Wonderful story. The road there is a bit tiring but beautiful and cobbled. The people are fantastic. At the entrance to the neighborhood there is a shop where you can stop for the toilet. Its owner took us by car to the castle. The ticket costs $4 / person. Young people with a student card pay only $1.2 (although sometimes they don't pay at all 😂). The view of the castle is wonderful during sunset, there is also a coffee bar inside."
Rozafa Castle,Adam Phillips,4,"An awesome castle which allows access nearly all areas. Great to climb the walls and get as close as I'd dare. You're in control of your own health and safety!  Very hot at height of summer.  Parking is not good. Head up to the top if you dare. Turning & reversing on narrow cobbles or rocks may be needed. I'd recommend parking before you go over the little bridge, then walk up.  Well worth a visit though. The views are absolutely stunning!"
Rozafa Castle,Csanád Zámbó,4,"The view is amazing, the entrance ticket is cheap, there is no tour guide, only some information boards. Not too crowded, everything is left as it was, except in one building. There is a museum inside the castle but it was closed."
Rozafa Castle,Dave Harper,4,Good place. Pretty historic castle on top of a hill. You can drive up by car but have the feeling you wont find parking space as therr is only few spots. By walking it is pretty hard and steep hike. On the other hand the views from top are amazing. Entry fee can be payed by card. The castle is pretty big. On top there is also small store selling water and similar. Recomend.
Rozafa Castle,Nani Rump,4,"Really large castle perched on a large hill overlooking Shkodër! They close at 21:00hrs but they let me in at 20:15 just after sunset. There are about 5 or so signs describing each courtyard and some of the buildings, but essentially, it's a ""choose your own adventure"" castle. Lots of people climbing around, some walls are quite small so people were perched on them. There is a cafe there and a museum for an extra fee but it was closed when I got there. Some parking down the bottom and then about a ten minute steep walk up slippery cobblestones to the castle entrance after the ticket booth."
Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg,Nich Radcliffe,5,"I had an excellent stay at your property. The food was outstanding. The room was beautiful. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.  My lone piece of constructive criticism is in regard to drinks at dinner. I stayed at the property as a part of the Christmas package. It would have been nice to have at least one beverage (wine, beer, mixed drink) and sparkling water for the evening included with the meal."
Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg,Steffen Rodig,4,"Great atmosphere, wonderful room overlooking the countryside. Delicious breakfast. Food at dinner was very good, but service slow. Staff always professionally friendly but seemed confused that our day plans didn't match their recommendations ;-) Wireless internet cumbersome. All in all a pleasant experience."
Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg,Bernard Oppel,5,"The ambience was great. The service ranged from outstanding to adequate depending on the task. Perhaps some of the staff have not adapted to the Romantik Hotel team approach yet.  Management went out of its way to retrieve a lost item for my companion.  Food was excellent, including the breakfast buffet."
Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg,Jack Boomsma,5,"Had diner there with my family. Excellent service, food and wine. The location, next to Wartburg castle and the view over the valley is amazing."
Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg,Tina G,5,"Fantastic setting, lovely views, great food, and wonderful deal for single travelers.  Small, but superbly appointed single rooms have everything you could want.  Abundant wall sockets for all your devices and electronics.  Abundant, fresh, superb breakfast."
Castelul Corvinilor (Corvins' Castle),Niko Adry,5,"It's one of the most beautiful castles I have ever seen! 😍 walking in the beautiful big rooms with bolted ceilings takes you back in time. The castle is extremely well preserved, especially considering that it was built in the 15th century (1440s). You can easily imagine how the nobles lived in those times. Absolutely gorgeous! We loved it so much and were so impressed by the architecture that stood strong till this day, that we decided to return and take our post wedding photos there, and it was the best decision we could make ❤️  Go visit!!! You will not regret it!"
Castelul Corvinilor (Corvins' Castle),Bogdan Campeanu,4,"Nice place to visit, lots of history to learn. Some of the rooms are pending renovation or are under renovation. We went with 3 kids, the small ones (3 &6) were not that enthusiastic about it as there are not so many attractions, some of the rooms are less 'interactive', rather static. I think of some small animations on some screens or projected. They loved that in some rooms there are some persons dressed like few hundred years ago and they played with their sword etc. We need more of this. Also, please solve the parking and toilets."
Castelul Corvinilor (Corvins' Castle),OffMarket Props,4,"It is truly an awe-inspiring location with a rich historical significance. This place undoubtedly deserves a 5-star rating for the profound representation it holds. However, there are a couple of aspects that slightly hinder its overall ranking.  Firstly, there is a notable concern regarding the maintenance of numerous items. While renovations were in progress during my visit, it seems that some items have been neglected for quite a while. Prioritizing their upkeep would greatly enhance the overall experience.  Secondly, the customer service personnel could use improvement. A more welcoming and accommodating approach would make visitors feel not only valued but also connected to the historical essence of the place. Feeling welcomed and a part of history should be an integral part of the visit experience."
Castelul Corvinilor (Corvins' Castle),Marina Trencheva,5,"An absolutely beautiful castle. Even though the castle is currently being renovated, you can still see most parts of it. If you are curious about Romanian history and want to learn more, then you should visit this place. If you want to avoid long queues for tickets, you should come a bit earlier in the morning.  The fee for the castle is about 40 lei. There are plenty of shops from where you can buy food and drinks. You can park your car in the nearest car park to the castle, about 8-10 minutes' walk. The fee for parking is 10 lei."
Castelul Corvinilor (Corvins' Castle),Ennun,5,"We came early in the morning, which proved to be the right decision, as, when we left, a lot of tourists started coming in, so if you can go early, it's probably best.  There were a few different exhibits taking place in sections of the castle, which was really nice to see. We also had the surprise of seeing a small performance in the castle's interior garden, which was very cute!"
Ducale Palace,Hao Yu,5,"Luckily, I spend about 5mins alone in the “Bridal‘s chamber”. Except Andrea Mantegna’s work, most impressive part to me is Roma gallery and the Troy apartment.jin"
Ducale Palace,Judy Hung,5,Stunning! A must visit while in Mantova. Very good English descriptions in every displayed rooms.
Ducale Palace,Kimba Frances Kerner,5,"Plan to come on a weekday because you can have the bridal chamber to yourself. We could tell that they were used to crowds but there was almost no one there at all. MUST SEE!! Do not skip this amazing palace when you are near Mantua. I can’t post photos of the beautiful interiors, but they will feed your soul."
Ducale Palace,Andrey Khorlin,5,"Great views from the top of castle. If the line to enter is not very long, it's definitely worth the visit."
Ducale Palace,Tobias Zido,5,Wonderful Place and a must see in Mantua. Historical and cultural highlight!
Nesvizh Radziwiłł Castle,Iv YT,5,We spent the whole day here with my family. It's a great tourist experience
Nesvizh Radziwiłł Castle,Nikita Savchenko,5,"Very clean and beautiful place! The castle itself is pretty compact, but the territory and nature around is wonderful. Pick at least 3-4 hours for this visit."
Nesvizh Radziwiłł Castle,Daiva Garneliene,5,"Extremely great and beautiful castle ! I have never seen anything like this before! Every step makes you wonder! Every room is more beautiful than previous. It is not like ordinary museum, it is like castle still inhabited by people. You can see furniture, dresses, paintings , curtains, bedrooms, even tables are set up for the dinner. You must visit it!"
Nesvizh Radziwiłł Castle,Anderson England,4,"Very professional restoration and beautiful grounds. I entered from the parking for hotel visitors. The ticket office was closed in the castle entrance and the guard did not understand my question as to where to go. There are poor markings for this information. A young man across the street at a period photo souvenir stand was helpful. I had to go to the other parking lot.  When I finally got my ticket and entered,  there was no instruction of where to go for the castle tour entrance. To be the number one tourist castle in Belarus the management here needs to improve the experience. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the grounds and the history. The miniature opera house was amazing."
Nesvizh Radziwiłł Castle,Оля Іващенко,4,Nice place to visit at Belorus! Better to take a guide especially if you are with children as he can make amazing advertising during the visit for the children of 9-12 days!( unfortunately we forget the name of the guide but he was just amazing!) besides there are some extra things to do with children near the castle or just to sit with beloved person on a branch with the view on nice lake…
Rundāle Palace Museum,Penko Penchev,5,"Magnificent Palace ❤️worth to visit 13€ it's more than a fair price for the Palace and the gardens 2 hours of a fairy tale. It's the number 1 spot to visit in Latvia Very well-preserved palace and gardens, knowledgeable staff, a nice coffee shop and souvenir shop Few car parks around and also a few guest's houses with good food and not too cheap prices. Have fun"
Rundāle Palace Museum,Cristi,5,"There is possibility to park in free working lot and then walk to ticket office. There are tickets for temporary exhibitions, the palace and the gardens. The palace was built by German origin dukes and then soon taken over by tsarist Russians. The interiors are very elegant. The gardens are huge and beautifully arranged and maintained. Different types of flowers and bushes to enjoy a walk through. Separate ticket required."
Rundāle Palace Museum,Darren Hartshorne,5,"Beautiful Palace with acres of beautifully manicured gardens, plans and trees.. can spend hours walking around just the gardens alone. Entry price is very reasonable for what can be made into a day out."
Rundāle Palace Museum,Andreas Heierli,5,"Beautiful castle and gardens. Excellent audio guide (download for free, free WiFi available throughout the property, don't forget to bring your headset). Major refurbishment work had to be done as the property was not adequately maintained during the communist occupation."
Rundāle Palace Museum,Mateusz Adamkiewicz * Матэвуш Адамкевіч,5,"A must see when in Latvia. The territory is huge. Make sure to have enough time to visit it all. 3 hours is enough if you just want to see beautiful places without delving too much into its history and the whole lore. The garden, on the other hand, was a little bit underwhelming (some parts seemed neglected). Altogether worth its price:)"
Royal Palace of Caserta,Ama N,5,"This place was a pleasant surprise, the grounds are well kept and the tour was active and fun. Loved the options, with kids we were grateful for the bike rental available. Made the visit fun and stress free. They also have a shuttle for a small fee for those who have mobility issues. Over all enjoyed our day inside the palace and the gardens."
Royal Palace of Caserta,Margarita Levsina,5,"Ticket 15 € per person for everything - castle, grounds and English garden. The castle is very beautiful.  2.50 € per person for a shuttle bus through the garden to the English Garden round trip. The English garden is a very beautiful place, there are many trees that create shade and it is pleasant to walk in the heat. In this garden, be sure to visit the bathroom of Venus. We spent 3 hours on everything, but you can walk there much longer, having picnics. Be sure to take water to the territory, you can buy it there only on the territory of the castle, there will be no further kiosks.  We arrived on Monday at 15:00 and there were no queues and there were few people."
Royal Palace of Caserta,Will G,4,"Wow! The garden itself was I task to visit. I would recommend either the shuttle or the golf cart. We took the shuttle which need like 10min to arrive on the top edge of the garden. Beautiful, lush greenery which is very well kept."
Royal Palace of Caserta,Simon Hedger,4,"Huge bourbon palace, take lots of water with you and ideally a packed lunch. The canteen here is chaotic badly organised and way too small given the numbers of visitors. Absolutely imperative to book tickets in advance as the queue on the day we went was at least 70-80 metres long and hardly seemed to move. The gardens are lovely but must be maybe 3km from the palace to the waterfall at the end of the drive. A shuttle bus was available as was bicycles and electric bikes."
Royal Palace of Caserta,Joe Nicol,5,"Better than Versailles in that somehow this place is not flooded with tourists, yet is so beautifully preserved/restored with some of the most incredible grounds and architecture I’ve ever seen. HIGHLY recommend taking the shuttle to the English Garden first, walking back to the palace and taking a break at the Cafe, then seeing the apartments. If you’re like me and can’t bear to be in a museum for more than 3 hours, you can easily do all of it in that amount of time and still feel like you learned something while seeing one of the most impressive royal residences in the world."
Château de Brissac,Brian Wood,5,"A wonderful tour in English & French of this historic building, which consists of a medieval ruin and a later rebuild blended together."
Château de Brissac,Christelle Hoareau,5,"Great castle to visit, still lived in by the Brissac family and the family pictures add a lovely touch"
Château de Brissac,Jean-Michel Regnier,5,lovely castle with very friendly guides. nice place to visit
Château de Brissac,Bob Morris,5,"It was a very powerful overwhelming chateau inside with wood beamed ceilings throughout the chateau. The beamed ceilings have detailed mini-scenes on them with other painted and gold accents on them. The husband's bedroom was one that shouldn't be missed. It was quite impressive and more than most of the other chateaus I have visited. The wife's bedroom was very nicely done. The theme throughout was with animal  antlers and animal heads on the walls. The kitchen was great to see, too! The grounds looking from the windows was pretty to see and photograph. There were very wonderful pieces of furniture with inlays and all. The tapestries were worth seeing. They even have a wine cellar where you can sample their wines for free and purchase bottles of you would like to. Many people were doing just that! Plus they have a room for staged performances to take place with theater seating and all! I definitely would recommend visiting this chateau. It has a lot to offer visitors to experience!"
Château de Brissac,Sarah Bone,5,Fascinating building in beautiful surroundings. Extremely well kept. The wine was good too!
Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial,Miassar Miski,5,"This is believed to be the largest Renaissance structure in the world. El Escorial is a complex of many buildings with different functions within one huge structure. The two major parts of the structure are the royal palace and the monastery. And within the premises of those two structures you happen upon  a basilica, pantheon, library, museum, university, school, and hospital. Along the time a small town developed around the building. El Escorial served as one of the seats for the Spanish monarchy. The mood in this palace is a little bit austere and somber. The Escorial is almost 50 km from Madrid. A bus service will take there. The admission fee is 10€ (2021 prices). Keep in mind that the Escorial is closed on Mondays. After visiting the Palace and the Monastery, you can walk to the adjacent town. There you will find many nice cafes and restaurants. The prices are fair and the mood is very relaxing."
Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial,FotorDG,5,"The is one of the most beautiful monastery's I've ever seen!! You don't have to pay to see the basilica but to see all the corners of the monastery you do have to pay 12€. There's discounts for students, children and seniors. I really advice the visit!!!! You can't take fotos or videos inside some rooms. It take more or less 3 hours to see everything. This place has incredible paintings and frescos. High recommend a tour throughout the big place!!"
Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial,Tyler Thompson,5,It’s only a short 50 minute train ride from Madrid. Beautiful little town that you can walk through or take the bus. The Palace/ Monastery is stunning and the self guided tour is well done. We saw so much on the tour. After we had a great lunch a block away. Great last minute day trip from Madrid.
Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial,Bethany Eckert,4,"My group wanted to take advantage of the free admission hours. It was okay but really not enough time to see everything since the free hours are so limited. If you're slow like me and want to read all the signs, just buy tickets for general admission. You won't be rushed and you'll have time to enjoy everything. The location is beautiful and the buildings are fantastic. Be aware you are not supposed to take photos indoors and they're pretty strict about it, so just don't."
Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial,Wei Zhang,3,"The history is rich and fascinating, the shifting of style from Habsburg to Bourbon is especially interesting.  But the staffs at audio guide counter are rude and unprofessional, they recommended the app to me which I'm not interested since I didn't have much power left on my phone. I said I prefer the tablet and they suddenly became irradiated and stated the app is better for us two, we can share the app; and ""you will be kicked out if you share the tablet"" . I don't understand how you can share a tablet with only one earphone and what part of contract I'd breach will result my immediate removal from the site. Judging from their tone, it wasn't simply a suggestion but a threat to me over my preference to a tablet. The staff at the library was very ""selective"" when checking tickets."
Rosenborg Castle,SebCeleste M,5,"Beautiful castle with a rose garden, a moat and a large park. It’s very peaceful and a nice place to take a break. There is a small play area for children in the park and you will find lots of families there.  The interiors are absolutely beautiful.  The castle gift shop is very nice and lots of nice articles."
Rosenborg Castle,Veronika Wilčkova,5,"Beautiful park in the middle of the city. Nice place for a walk. Picnic. There is also a children's playground. The castle is smaller, although it does not look out of the photos. Well worth a visit. Free admission to the park (we were not inside the castle)"
Rosenborg Castle,Sam Liddicoat,5,"A beautiful castle from the outside, filled with decadent displays of royal wealth on the inside. It's good value for the price as each room has something fascinating to look at.  The basement, featuring the collection of ivory sculptures and the crown jewels is absolutely amazing, it's truly staggering how much wealth is on display here.  The outside rose gardens are also lovely to walk through and get a great view of the castle."
Rosenborg Castle,Didi Annandale,5,"Rosenberg Castle is impressive.  I'd recommend buying a ticket in advance, otherwise you could wait 1 hour or more, this time could also be used to have a picnic in the Kings Garden filled with many statues and a stunning Rose garden which is great to fill the time until you can go in. We got the 6 in 1 ticket ( this includes Rosenberg Castle, Palm House and Natural Museum, SMK, the workers museum, the David collection, and the Hirschsprung collection - we saved quite a bit, and is valid for an entire year with 1 entry to each place) The garden around the castle has amazing views of the Royal Guards training yard, and if you're lucky, you can see them either doing some training or practicing drills. Inside the castle, it is truly beautiful. All of the rooms have original wall panels (some made of fabric wall paper and some painted wood) with amazing tapestries all over the place. There is a beautiful collection of beautiful Ivory, glass, and amber figurines as well as antique furniture  pieces around all the rooms. Besides looking inside the castle, there is also the basement. One room in the basement holds all the crown jewelry. A stunning sight to see. While walking around, don't forget to look up and down. The ceilings, which are decorated with intricate and delicately painted murals and floors with unique designs, are as beautiful as many of the pieces on exhibit. A must visit, in my opinion"
Rosenborg Castle,Hasan Dastgir,5,"What a beautiful place to visit. Even though I didn't go inside, I loved seeing the castle from the outside. The gardens are amazing, and the castle itself looks really impressive. It's a great spot to take pictures and enjoy the atmosphere of Copenhagen. Easily accessible by public transport."
Frederiksborg Castle,Victor Correra,4,"Nice castle in small town 40 minutes from Copenhagen.  A little bit expensive, but I guess a lot goes into maintaining the castle and the gardens.  The gardens are free, so that’s great.  The castle itself has a lot of paintings and beautiful woodwork.  Recommend if you have a free slot in your time here in Denmark."
Frederiksborg Castle,Noha Afifi,5,Definitely worth the visit. It’s such a stunning castle with so many rooms and paintings. Has so many history for many centuries.  You can take the train line A from Copenhagen central station for 38 minutes with around 10€ and you will then walk around 17 minutes to reach the castle. The scenery from the lake is breathtaking.  I definitely recommend visiting it as it’s a must see while you are visiting the Denmark.
Frederiksborg Castle,Chicco,5,"On the way back to Copenhagen we stopped here to visit this castle. It surely deserved the stop. The location and the architecture is impressive as the number of rooms to visit. The chapel, the great hall and the audience chamber are worth the ticket (110 kr).  It would be necessary hours to properly visit it but not less than 1 h and half should be taken to decently visit it, in my opinion. Not counting the gardens, of course. The visiting path is clearly shown. One of the must-do things in Denmark for sure."
Frederiksborg Castle,Priscilla Zhang,4,"This is a really opulent castle and it was very beautiful to walk around. The building and its decorations were very intricate. But the museum plaques will only teach you about the portraits on the walls, and most rooms are empty except for the paintings."
Frederiksborg Castle,Shreyas Janivar,4,It’s a bit slow to reach from Copenhagen. But a beautiful castle! Pro tip - reach there early morning in summer. The sun will be opposite for really good photographs.
Palace of Versailles,R R,5,"The palace is immense and beautiful. I strongly recommend having the audio tour because there is so much history and details in every room of the palace.  My recommendation is to arrive early because the queue is long and you need a lot of time to visit all the places: the palace(2 hours) and the gardens (3 hours). Bring sunscreen and food.  In the back section of the garden there is a section in which you could have a picnic. If you have food and water, you will enjoy lunch in a lovely spot."
Palace of Versailles,Sa Br,4,The palace was super cool but there were so many people. As we walked around we noticed that there were huge crowds in all of the bedrooms and the crowd was less cramped in every other part of the palace. This was a cool experience but probably not something to go back to multiple times again. All of the rooms were pretty similar after a while and almost seemed like an art museum so keep that in mind if you’re not super into old art and furniture. Overall good experience.
Palace of Versailles,Katerina Dmitrieva,4,"Wonderful place but too crowded.... a lot of people inside Castle, so u can't see anything. Atmosphere in the garden is much better. You can make there boat ride as well. In petite trianon, much less people. Tickets need to have much more ahead, and anyway, u will spend time in the line. A lot of wonderful gift shops, a huge selection of books, but all on the French language."
Palace of Versailles,Mo shay,4,Very crowded but a beautiful sight to visit with a tour guide. We recommend spending about 15-20% indoor and the majority if your time outdoors in the gardens. Absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing to visit. Ensure to book tickets before you visit.
Palace of Versailles,Zqgyt. 734,5,"Exquisitely beautiful and historical palace. I was almost on the verge of giving it four stars due to the sheer number of crowds visiting but then when you think about it, this is a testimony of the beauty and popularity of Versailles. Be prepared to walk a lot. Try to admire despite the crowds. But all the staffs were very helpful. I would give 10 stars if I could. And pictures could never do justice to it. It has to be seen in person. 😁"
Hotel América (Granada),Jerzy Żygłowicz,1,"Not possible to drink anything, despite is marked as bar and snacks. Waiter was very rude. Edit after hotel response: I've waited for service but waiter was busy with swiping floor rather than us. So asked kindly for drink. In response: ""no drinks only food"", this is different than ""we are booked please come back later"". Anyway other opinions says clearly service level here. As opposite I suggest ""Jardines de Alberto"" Restaurant very close. That one is perfect!"
Hotel América (Granada),Yunjui Tiffany Lee,5,"We ordered Spanish omelette, grilled fish and roasted chicken tights. All of them were absolutely amazing. We also had fresh orange juice and the sangria, fantastic place for lunch when you visit Alhambra"
Hotel América (Granada),陳薇文,5,Grilled fish. Roasted chicken. Spanish omelet ! Foods are super delicious!(too great to take pictures) Sangria is good! Orange juice is excellent! Service is also nice! Place is really suit for saving starved hungers in Alhambra!
Hotel América (Granada),Sinan Kula,1,"Waste of money.  We went here for a lunch during our visit of Al Hambra. The decoration is nice and the service also, but the food is beyond bad and overpriced.  We ordered some fries and calamari. The calamari was nearly raw and it seemed as if was chewing on gum. They also had it swimming in olive oil.  The fries were also very bad (i still dont understand how you can make bad fries), especially since they charged 6 euros for a portion…  I understand that the price is somewhat higher because if the location, but at least provide some quality.."
Hotel América (Granada),Pamella Martins,5,I didnt stay at the hotel. I had lunch at the restaurant and let me tell you... it was phenomenal!!!!! Angelo took care of me and he was just perfect. I was thinking the whole time I wanna hug him and he came at the end and did give me a hug🥰🥰🥰
Nymphenburg Palace,Jad Badran,5,Great architecture surrounded by very beautiful scenery. Large parking available nearby and the palace is easily accessible by public transport.  I did not visit the inside though.  Very nice free photo opportunity in front of the castle especially on sunny days !  The place is very clean and well maintained
Nymphenburg Palace,Lucy Nguyen,4,"I enjoyed this Palace immensely. This German palace has a lot history in it, and was preserved well. There was so many little rooms you can travel through. I love looking at the art and architecture when I was there. High recommend!"
Nymphenburg Palace,Armita,5,One of the most amazing and beautiful gardens I’ve visited. The grounds are huge and the gardens are free to visit. You can spend almost all day there to visit all the amazing places. There are free parking nearby s well. The main palace building is a huge villa with two wings that had 16 rooms. The rooms are decorated beautifully with luxury furnitures.
Nymphenburg Palace,Bharath Kumar,4,"Very beautiful palace with great architecture. Palace is well maintained. Very good place to bring kids. Unfortunately we are not able to visit all attractions in the palace. We went only for Galarie and that was really great. They have almost 300 parking places, we can park for free. Every attraction has a price other than visit to Garden. They have a Gondola too inside, we can ride with a price."
Nymphenburg Palace,Anup Dash,4,"The place is very nice and scenic. If you are interested to visit inside the Palace, you need to purchase €10 ticket. For guided trip and museum, you need to pay an additional €8. During my visit a few rooms were closed due to renovation. During weekend, expect a queue of 10-20 people for the tickets. Also inside the Palace."
Aljafería Palace,Ève S.,5,"You NEED to make an online reservation first. I assume it’s not as busy outside of the summer months, but I had to come back the next day because I didn’t realize they would run out of tickets. A few other people were in my situation too, so it’s quite common.  I highly recommend one of the guided visits. It really helped appreciate and understand everything we were seeing. There’s one in English at 11 AM and one in French at 5 PM and a bunch in Spanish.  It was a wonderful visit. I really loved everything about it and I spent quite some time there. It’s really cool to see the Muslim palace, the Christian palace in the modern parliament in one place."
Aljafería Palace,Rosie Osmun,5,"This was a nice late afternoon stop on a hot summer day, interesting rooms to explore and nice architecture details. There was a gravel parking lot toward the back and a nice little park around the grounds. Just be mindful of the time when you go as it is closed between 2:30-4pm."
Aljafería Palace,Macarena Qb,5,"Surprised with the visit. Very positive.  There was queue just before the museum opened but it was easily managed and moved quickly.  We were three and just paid 7€ for a guided visit with a group,  really affordable.  Our tour guide, Alvaro gave us all the details to understand the whole structure.  Although it was extremely noisy and in my opinion, school visits should have specifically reserved slots or even days. It's great cultural place for them to learn but also hard to keep kids on low level of noise when the excitement hits. Other than that, a great day learning about it. Defo a must go when in Zaragoza."
Aljafería Palace,Fiona Reynolds,4,"A small but historically significant castle to visit. Interesting process by which to purchase tickets. Reserve a slot online, take your reservation to the ticket booth outside the castle and pay the ticket price either in cash or by card. A hybrid of online booking.  And a beautiful place to visit."
Aljafería Palace,Shoe Princess,5,"Immerse yourself into this oasis of calm and inner peace, admire the stunning lacy mudejar architectural details and forget for a few hours of daily life. Make sure you book your visit  online as turning up doesn't suffice (this place hosts the Aragonese Parliament, that's why). A must if you're in Zaragoza."
Royal Alcázar of Seville,Erin,5,"Absolutely gorgeous Palace, very well preserved and taken care of. Gardens are lovely and go on forever. Definitely worth a visit. We bought tickets two days in advance during peak season (Early August) and it was limited tickets left so definitely suggest buying in advance. We got there at 10am (our booked time) and essentially walked straight in with no wait. We were there on a near 40 degree day but found it relatively cool inside the palace and especially in the gardens."
Royal Alcázar of Seville,Sue Vogt-Skard,5,"We visited here in 2019 and again today. I loved it the first time and just as much the second time too.  It’s an amazing palace and gardens. So much to look at.  Seville was pretty quiet when we visited in July but this was the one place that was busy, although we queued for 30 mins for a ticket to enter immediately- so better than our previous visit in March.  The palace is more busy than the gardens and on the second visit we spent more time outside sitting in the tranquil gardens. Easy to spend a delightful 3 hours here."
Royal Alcázar of Seville,Danilas Pavilionis,5,"A true must see in the heart of Seville, you do not want to be frugal on this one, it is really worth it. Beautiful place no matter where you go and very big too, it could be hard to visit every room and garden without a map (which you can take at the entrance). Apart from the magnificent interior and gardens, you can find many peacocks just chilling somewhere near the trees and bushes. And for the tickets it would be smart to buy them in advance."
Royal Alcázar of Seville,khawla ouhamma,4,"Great experience, got visit a part of history. The architecture is fascinating. You could see the different eras that have lived and passed through it. The gardens are so beautiful, and each one is special to an era of history. I'm giving it 4 stars because as the payment is done by card only it creates a bit of a hassle for tourists that have cash only so I've seen people on the line with me that have left for this reason."
Royal Alcázar of Seville,Mari Meirelles,5,"The Real Alcazar of Sevilla is an absolute gem! Stepping into its halls is like stepping back in time. It’s a mix of buildings and styles. But the well preserved decorated walls in the inside of the buildings impressed me most. The gardens and the fountains are beautiful too. When you buy the tickets for the general visit, you can use it to visit the Sevilla antiquarian and the ceramic museum, so don’t miss these opportunities too."
National Trust - Powis Castle and Garden,P G,5,"A stunning National Trust Property.  The grounds are picture perfect and have resident peacocks roaming the paths and lawns outside. They really are a wonderful addition.  Inside the property, there are so many interesting things to see. The portrait of Lady Eleanor Percy later Powis opposite her book of hours was great.  There was plenty of choice in the cafe and an ice cream stall outside for something to cool you down on a hot day.  The shop had a lovely selection of National Trust items."
National Trust - Powis Castle and Garden,Gillian Leong,5,"What a lovely time we had. Wonderful helpful and knowledgeable staff. Interesting building with a very special atmosphere. Great having bus service back up to either car park or house. Wonderful well kept gardens. Although car park was very full the house and particularly gardens did not feel overcrowded. Some items in house could do with a dust 😉 as you could not see their beauty, but that's only a minor issue. A headphone guide would be useful, I wouldn't mind paying extra for that as we couldn't always get to see the information booklet. But well worth the visit, highly recommend ❤️"
National Trust - Powis Castle and Garden,Veronika N,5,"This place is definitely worth a visit. The exposition is interesting, the view is stunning and the garden is amazing. The car park is big. We visited the castle on Saturday and the car park looked almost full when we arrived but there was still enough space to park. Despite the number of cars, as the area around the castle is large, the visitors spread and it wasn't overcrowded."
National Trust - Powis Castle and Garden,Lisa Langton,5,"What a beautiful place to come and see. Although it was quite cloudy and drizzly, the views were still stunning. The gardens are the best kept I have ever seen at a NT property. Faultless, beautiful, lush, colourful, clean, and weed free. Total respect and thanks for the team of gardeners that must work tirelessly to keep the gardens in such outstanding conditions. Inside the castle, you are not permitted to take photos. The rooms are quite dark, but there is so much to protect from the sunlight. The painted walls and ceilings are breathtaking. There was so much to look at, and the volunteers were very knowledgeable when questions were asked. I could write so much more, but honestly, you just need to visit to see for yourself!"
National Trust - Powis Castle and Garden,Cymru Jon,5,"Possibly the most picture perfect of all the National Trust properties we've visited. The view of the medieval castle from the terraces and lawns below is stunning. Much to explore including paths through the trees, multiple garden areas, orangery, the castle and courtyard. Don't miss the quieter terrace by the castle east entrance for more wonderful views. Allow at least 4 hours here."
Sudeley Castle,Angie K,5,"Fantastic place to visit, packed with history. Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I are only some of the historic figures who lived here. The castle is not particularly big but is very interesting to explore. The garden is very pretty, too, as well as the chapel."
Sudeley Castle,susanna roberts,5,"Loved this place, hadn't realised how much history is associated to Sudeley Castle, so much to see. Grounds were beautiful, the Animal Ark sculptures were a delight for the kids to find. Exhibitions inside were immense, well presented and interesting. We paid extra for guided tour and I really felt it was worthwhile, very knowledgeable tour guide and delivered in an interesting manner. My only reservation was that the main restaurant is at entry, so half way through our visit we had to walk back to the start to enjoy lunch. The food was good, we enjoyed soup. Also kids play area looks fab, lots to play on. Kids got in free with Blue Peter badges too, great saving. Great day out, highly recommend. Don't forget to like my review 😀"
Sudeley Castle,Jane D,5,"Such a fascinating Castle to visit, which was steeped in significant history. It is so worth having the Guide (Laura?) tell you about the history of the Castle so that you can fully appreciate everything about it. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn visited the Castle and Katherine Parr had lived there and her tomb is in the church. There are many unique artifacts there of great interest. I highly recommend  a visit if you are interested in Tudor history."
Sudeley Castle,Nicola Hones,5,"Beautiful interior house with added ruins that enhance it's appeal gardens interesting, however the church was out of bounds due to a tree having come down. The animal garden awareness theme of how wildlife and domestic life can live together was interesting too."
Sudeley Castle,Pam Hawkes,5,Just walked around the gardens this time. The fragrance from the  roses was amazing. The sculpture animals are well worth a visit. Had lunch in the new style cafe interior design was very well laid out and good quality food.
Alnwick Castle,Aaron Freeman-Powell,5,An excellent family day out. Good value for what you got. Beautiful grounds. Very good birds of prey display. Dragon quest very fun and surprising. Clay making for kids free and good.
Alnwick Castle,helen taylor,5,Great day out for all the family. Inside is absolutely beautiful unfortunately you cant take photos as its still a family home. Very fun for kids and the dragon quest is so much fun.
Alnwick Castle,adam holden,5,"Cool place, second largest inhabited castle behind Windsor. Definitely worth getting the tours to fill you in on the history of the castle. Also do the movie tour and hear all about the films filmed there. All the staff are lovely and very passionate about what they do and the local area. Definitely a must see if you're in the Northumbrian area."
Alnwick Castle,Randy Wrinkle,5,This was a hard one for me. The castle is beautiful and well maintained. However I love to go everywhere and see all of the castle. I do not care much for modern parts of castles. I view them from a medieval perspective. This one has many other things happening. The Harry Potter stuff is nice for those that are into that. There is also a nice children's area.
Alnwick Castle,Peter Carlton,5,"It is a lovely place to visit. Allan, our historic tour guide, was brilliant. He  had a lovely personality and was full of humour, too. There's plenty to see. Allow at least 3 hours to have a good look around."
National Trust - Scotney Castle,Stephanie Ward,5,"A wonderful day out! Such a beautiful place to spend your time. The castle was lovely, the cafe had a good selection and the gift shop and plant shop were also great. The gardens were beautiful. Lots of countryside to walk through. The staff were great."
National Trust - Scotney Castle,Sami P,5,What a beautiful castle! This has definitely been one of my favourites. The castle and the surroundings are breathtaking. There is a small playground and many spots to sit or for a picnic. Staff are friendly and enhance the whole experience.  Definitely recommend a visit!
National Trust - Scotney Castle,Ky “Kye” Boot,5,"Lovely day out, grounds are absolutely stunning, so peaceful too! Free entry for National Trust members! Staff all over the site and at the cafe are really friendly and clearly love what they do. Would definitely recommend a visit! :)"
National Trust - Scotney Castle,Sue Williams,5,Loved seeing the old castle ruins in the lovely ground. Brings an aura of romance. Be aware it is advised that you book in advance to secure a parking space...
National Trust - Scotney Castle,Robert Birkholz,5,"Great castle to visit with two separate parts - old castle and new house. It has a long and rich history and beautiful trails.  It's easy accessible with parking and overflow parking, big tearoom with outside space, and fantastic National Trust staff members. It's worth visiting for sure!"
Casalbi ApS,Kelli Christensen,5,Beautiful place to take your family for the day.
Le Troubadour,Denver Milne,5,"Absolutely lovely restaurant with a fantastic menu. The food is brilliant, obviously only using the highest quality ingredients. The staff are very professional and attentive, when we asked if there was a vegetarian option the chef prepared a very extravagant plate worthy of my 5 star rating.  Thank you for a lovely lunch."
Le Troubadour,Mavie,5,"We’ve been to France last summer for vacation and this restaurant was recommended to us to try. I have to say - this was probably the best food that has ever touched my mouth in my life (not overexaggerating). We didn’t really understand the menu so we just chose based on what Google translated to us and what the waiter suggested us to try. I don’t even know what I ate in the starter course, but the taste was something I’ve never had before and it was amazing. The main course, too, was cooked to the point and just had this special taste that you really don’t get everywhere. I can fully recommend this restaurant for anyone to try - I hope I’ll someday come back!"
Le Troubadour,Julia Say,5,We had an excellent meal here. Every course was well presented and delicious. Highly recommend a visit.
Le Troubadour,Jus Pur,3,"If you can manage to catch them for their one sitting per lunch or dinner session, yes, one, then a pretty location at the foot of the chateau.  Have a look online to see if it will suit your needs as the menu for mains is limited to four items so may not have something for everyone.  Starters were great, mains were passable.  Burgers were well undercooked despite cooking to order. Not something most teens deal well with.  Duck was undercooked (blue rare vs medium rare) but I don’t mind that so much. It was simple, basic duck on potatoes. I wouldn’t order it again.  The risotto to start was fantastic, which gets it to 3* from 2*.  Wonderful location. Inattentive staff despite having only a handful of tables.  There’s a second restaurant in town that I’d try first now that I’ve been."
Le Troubadour,C K,5,"We visited the Chateau de Hautefort on May 31, 2023 and was lucky to find this amazing restaurant! We were a group of 4 and could not speak French. But the gentleman and a young boy who helped our order were so friendly, thoughtful and patient. The food was so tasty and creatively presented. This is our favorite restaurant during our 7-day stay in Sarlat La Caneda. This is a true gem of a restaurant. Two thumbs up!! Merci beaucoup!"
Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg,Alexander K,5,A wonderful monument you must visit during your stay in Alsace!  It is one of the most complex castles ever rebuilt in the area and has the best panoramic views on the region below.  The castle offers tours (included in your entry ticket) and we had a great time with our tour guide Jacques K. Very interesting person with so many interesting facts to talk about the castle!
Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg,Yu Kho,5,"A beautiful and interesting place to visit for both children and adults. Fantastic views to enjoy. There are a library and a restaurant available. Car park is free of charge, many car parking spaces available along the road but can be challenging to find a slot during the busy times. We loved the place. Thank you!"
Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg,Katie Sutton,3,Very cool castle but VERY crowded. Don’t be afraid to drive closer to the front to find parking. Everyone followed each other and parked way down the mountain but if you drive up closer to the entrance you’ll likely find a bunch of empty spots and won’t have to walk as far.  Lots of history to read as you walk through. Beautiful views.
Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg,Amin Mansouri,4,A beautiful place mostly from the outside. The inside is also interesting but can be visited in an hour. The views of the top towers are amazing though and certainly are worth checking out. There are many staircases so not a very easy to visit castle for older people or people with disabilities. And it's not expensive (7 euros for students.) Enjoy!
Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg,Roxana to you,5,"I loved the visit in this castle 🏰. Indeed it is big (compared with other castles that i've seen) very well maintained and it has amazing views over the mountains 🏞. Being this big, you need to allocate the right amount of time 🕝 to see it properly and unfortunately we were a bit in a hurry 🥺."
Castillo Almodovar del Rio,林卡爾,4,"Beautiful place with beautiful views. It has a lot of historic information about the castle in English and other languages.  The views from the battlements over the countryside transports you back to another time in history, it’s naturally immersive!  Nice place to stop by when you’re out and about.  There is a car park at the bottom of the hill and there’s one closer to the castle. It’s worth checking the one closer to the castle if you don’t fancy walking up there."
Castillo Almodovar del Rio,Ben Braun,5,"Highly recommended visit! Grand castle a short drive away from Cordoba.  The castle itself is in perfect condition and invites the visitor to explore it and it's history. What is even better is the panoramic view from the castle's many towers.  Of course, for fans of Game of Thrones a must visit, as it was a filming location in the series.  The visit takes about 1-2 hours."
Castillo Almodovar del Rio,Galib Bin Mohammad,5,"One of the best middle aged castle - built by Muslims! Grand, tactical, practical, majestic! Very worthy to spend 2-3 hours. Don’t miss if you are in Cordoba."
Castillo Almodovar del Rio,Florin Baban,5,No words to describe the experience. We've made a small stop while traveling from Sevilla to Cordoba with the intention of visiting the castle and eat something in the village. Huge surprise we had discovering that many scenes from the popular series GOT were filmed here. The conservation level is amazing and really worth the visit.
Castillo Almodovar del Rio,Sara Pates,5,"Lovely castle of your imagination. We'll worth a visit, even though it was 35°, there was plenty of shade. Decibel drive up to the potemkin parking! There was no charge and it saves a long slog up the hill... Wish we'd known that!"
Château de Peyrepertuse,Moronic Smurf,4,Ah nice little historical tourist trap. The drive up is a workout for your car and bike. make sure your cooling works. Its a ruin and cost 7 euro to enter. After entering its about a 1.5km hike on a small rocky path which i don't think is suitable for people with knee or health issues.
Château de Peyrepertuse,Jen Lagasse,5,So worth the climb for the stunning views. Skip the audio guide and make sure to wear sturdy shoes and bring a water bottle. Toilets available near the entrance and there are vending machines with cold drinks at the welcome center.
Château de Peyrepertuse,Dave Brown,5,"Another spectacular Cathar castle vying for the top spot. Almost 3 castles in one, this place is amazing and offers equally mega views to Queribus. A little more wild and be careful placing your feet this one is definitely worth the climb. Loved it!"
Château de Peyrepertuse,Jamie Hay,5,Amazing castle. Lots to look at in the ruined castle and some spectacular views to the sea and mountains.
Château de Peyrepertuse,Roman Chertov,5,"It is a bit of a hike over some steep medieval stairs, but the views are gorgeous"
Castillo de Alburquerque,ej rideout,5,Very nice castillo. Walk through old town to arrive. Good historical description provided. You can see to Portugal
Castillo de Alburquerque,Curtis Beach,5,"Views that look just like Albuquerque, New Mexico"
Castillo de Alburquerque,terry cullinan,5,Very quiet very lovely
Castillo de Alburquerque,Ste Testa,5,"Magnificent castle from the medieval age. Superb views, nice place very recommended."
Castillo de Alburquerque,M.,5,Amazing views.
Zil Castle,Os Wa,4,It’s very nice place for the people who love history there is a information explainer every part of the castle the ticket is cheap 12t 0.44$USD and I really like it and I recommend it
Zil Castle,Ayse Oz,4,Nice views from castle to river and mountains.  Interesting that a castle was built here. Small cattle can finish touring it in about 15mins entry was 12TL.  Next door is cafe parking was free.
Zil Castle,Daniela Segoloni,5,"Located in a marvelous place this castle, well preserved, gas a fantastic sightseeing The entrance fee si only 12 TL Not to miss!!"
Zil Castle,Shaher Abbarah,3,"It is a simple, small castle, Tickets 12 tl, no waiting. If you don't have enough time in your trip, just pass it and go to the waterfalls"
Zil Castle,Dmitry Sviridov,5,"Nice place, worth visiting. Picturesque views. Easy to park the car. The road is good."
Szigliget,Danielle Kiff,5,"Beautiful castle ruins.  Well worth the climb, this castle is not for the faint of heart, you have quite the hike up to get to it.  Some activities available to do, gift shop, snack bar etc.  I personally enjoyed how much of the original structure was there so it was very open for viewing."
Szigliget,Joanna Bohata,5,Beautiful ruins of a fortress on a hill with nice exhibition rooms. You can easily spend here up to 2 hours and the admittance fee is OK (HUF 1000 per adult and 500 for kid).
Szigliget,Pooja Kukreja,5,"Beautiful castle ruins which offers a mesmerizing view of lake balaton and its surroundings. It has a reasonable entry fee of 2000 HUF for adults and 1000 HUF for children. It looks like a long and difficult hike to get to the top but trust me it’s not!! It is fairly easy. There is a free parking, few souvenir shops and couple of places for a quick refreshment. Definitely worth a visit!!"
Szigliget,Chiara Mori,5,"The castle is really nice to see, the view from the top is amazing. Dogs are allowed inside, of all sizes, which is really nice. The price are for adults and children (adults: 2000 ft for person) and dogs don’t pay. Going on the top of the castle the stairs starts to get a little steeps, so maybe for a big dog would not be easy. There’s also a stand inside for tourists gadgets and they have a little theatre for comedy show and some others things, but of course is in Hungarian."
Szigliget,Jack Jeon,5,"Do you want to go to the castle ruins? Than this is the place. You can watch the lake too in a good weather from the top. Looks poorly managed in reviews, but it's actually very well managed and well displayed place with descriptions, explanations of the history and how people lived in the place. There's an entrance fee in the gates, so don't just go past him."
Yilan Castle,Senem Kılıç,5,"It is a must-see and a place that you will enjoy more if you either tell or listen to its story. For families with old and small children, I recommend you to set your arrival time to either sunrise or sunset, as you know the heat of troubled Adana."
Yilan Castle,Ayça,5,"It's a place I've wanted to go for a long time. I would definitely recommend. Ideal for those who like to climb. Unfortunately, it is a bit troublesome for the elderly and children 🙃"
Yilan Castle,JM MA,3,Spectacular views but Very difficult to access and dangerous
Yilan Castle,Hatice Özdemir,5,Perfect
Celje Castle,Matthijs Keij,5,"Visiting this castle is a 1 to 2 hour experience. There is a lot of information about the history of the castle and the counts of Celje. In the interior there are some interactive displays and small exhibitions. Of course you have a fantastic view over Celje. Just keep in mind that it's mostly a castle ruin (still impressive).  If you don't want to travel to Maribor to visit ""the world's oldest noble vine"" you will find a sibling of this vine tree in the castle garden."
Celje Castle,Lia Dekker,5,This castle is definitely worth you’re time. Entrance fee isn’t expensive (7 euro’s) and the castle is lovely! We were there mid July and surprised that it wasn’t packed with people (which was a nice surprise). Dogs are allowed in; they even got a treat!
Celje Castle,Kevin Grahame,5,"Great castle you can drive to or walk the very steep old gravel path that takes about 30 mins. Lots of history, great views and a nice cafe."
Celje Castle,Maxim Blokhin,5,"Amazing views over the town of Celje and it's surroundings. Great drinks in the castle's cafe. The whole place has been very well taken care of. Interesting themed events take place here from time to time. Would definitely go there again, next time with kids!"
Celje Castle,Emanuel Erben,5,Very nice castle with great explanations and a beautiful view over celje. Definitely worth a visit. You can park in front of/ near the castle or hike up to it. Whatever you like.
Buda Castle,Marcu Daniel,5,"Great  place to spend some time. The art gallery inside can be viewed in about 2-3 hours if you take your time. You can also climb the dome and get a view of the city from above. The gardens outside were in maintenance, but you can still find a lot of great places to take some photos. There are 2 cafes inside and one souvenir shop. Overall great experience and worth visiting"
Buda Castle,natalie alz,4,"Loved they have plenty of options, lot of places was under contraction and weren’t available. Was pretty cold (January after all) And walking in it felt like being part of history, the view  the city is great. Not very high but is good"
Buda Castle,Pranav Rathi,5,Right now some construction is going on. You can not visit inside as a castle because it was looted during WWII but you can visit the museums inside. Outside it is beautiful to visit in early morning and the evening when the light are on (they turnoff the lights at 10pm). The view of the city from here is phenomenal.
Buda Castle,Sumanta Chakraborty,5,"Great structure on the top of mountain, beside the river Danube. Sprawling across a large area. The views are breathtaking. You can either take a fernacular or walk. The walking is not too tiring and you get to see a few viewpoints as well. I have not entered the museum and hence cannot comment. But the place was empty early in the morning, like 8:30 AM. Also the bus 16 is the best option to visit the castle from the Pest part of the city. This bus directly links to Tram 2. Overall, great experience."
Buda Castle,Ádám Veres,5,The diamond on the crown of Budapest. Fascinating historic buildings (a few under reconstruction at the moment). Breathtaking view from the walls to the city. You just cannot miss it if you visit Budapest. The National Galery and the Budapest Histroy Museum also provide spectacular experience.
Palanok Castle,Timika Szegedi,4,"It was nice overall, you can learn about history, legends and have a view over the town of Mukachevo. The only issue is that more than half of the museums were closed as usual. You have the opportunity to get a tour guide and some souvenirs. Also, it's a good idea to visit the castle 🏰 for the night view of the town, the castle closes at 5pm."
Palanok Castle,Y Kuhta,5,"Best castle in Ukraine. No caps! You won’t find any better castle in entire Ukraine. Pleasant guide tour, revitalized buildings and brilliant view onto Mukachevo city. Fond of Palanok castle."
Palanok Castle,Alexander Alec,5,History always had a dark side to itself and this castle is not less than any other. The castle was build for sake of love but the Queen left the castle and ended up in church too clean up after the ceremonies and Sunday gatherings. Not like castles you will find in England and Europe.
Palanok Castle,Nico Popovich,5,"Amazing place, you can find it romantic and  majestic at the same time A lot of interesting locations,sadly it's Covid pandemic, so we weren't able to enter each exposition, but a lot of them were opened. Highly recommend for visiting"
Palanok Castle,Zelig Steiner,5,"Wow. A must visit! Gorgeous castle dating back almost a thousand years (with changes over time) and stunning views of the surrounding country and Eastern Carpathians. If you do one thing in Mukacheve, do this."
Vahramashen Church,Gustavo Molitor Porcides,5,"A small church surrounded by an amazing landscape. The church is located near the fortress Amberd. Well worth the trip.  Outside, there are people selling souvenirs and some snacks. The toilets are pretty clean."
Vahramashen Church,Arsen Manukyan,5,Great view and historical places!
Vahramashen Church,Sarah Quigaman,4,"You cannot miss to visit this church after going from amberd, the view was magnificent up here."
Vahramashen Church,Hayk Ghazarian,5,"A small, cozy church close to Amberd. The scenery here is beautiful."
Vahramashen Church,Garik H,3,"This church is located in incredible place, between mountains."
Almourol Castle,G Roberts,5,"Pretty cool castle. Not huge, but enough the be worth the visit. You take a small boat over for €4 and it'll give you some nice views for pics. You can then walk up to the castle for some beautiful views of the Targus River. There's also a small restaurant overlooking the river when done to refresh."
Almourol Castle,Raquel Leitao,3,"The castle is really pretty, amazing view of the river and it's surroundings. However, there are a few unprotected areas that can be dangerous (i had trouble going there, being afraid of highs and no rail to hang on). Also, the boat trip there is pricey (4€). There's only one boat, so you have to wait (not long, the trip is less than 5 min, which again makes me wonder why its so expensive)."
Almourol Castle,Vladimir Adamec,5,Beautiful and well preserved castle! Make sure to plan your trip as the boat that gets you there is having a break from 12.30pm to 2.30pm.
Almourol Castle,Caio Haddad Franco,4,"Very nice view of the castle from the harbour. If you wish to visit the castle and the island, be aware of the schedule and frequency of the official boat (summer time it states that goes until 18:30h, but actually when it gets close to 18:00h it is only possible to return from castle to harbour, trips to castle will not be possible)."
Almourol Castle,Clive Hanks,5,"Awesome experience immersed in history, best value tourism experience in Portugal.. Incredible."
Guimarães Castle,Gustavo R,5,"Absolutely beautiful and really takes one back almost a millennia, to when Portugal people and kingdom just started. Museum and castle visitation is very well organized, comprehensive and insightful!"
Guimarães Castle,Guillermo Molina Burguera,4,"Restored 15th-century palace with a great collection of furniture, weapons, pottery, paintings, etc. to represent the appearance of the different rooms (dinning-room, bedroom, Chapel...). Artefacts and furniture are representatives from 15th to 19th centuries, being some if them copies. It really worths a visit."
Guimarães Castle,Marie O,5,This visit is doable in an hour. It’s well preserved and has great views of the city and old town. There’s parking around the castle.
Guimarães Castle,Efi,4,"The castle is well-conserved, and it’s a great place to visit. Come on! It’s a castle from the X Century. It’s worth the visit. I don't give it a 5 star because the visit lacks some more info signs/points. It would be nice to have some more signs with some info."
Guimarães Castle,T,5,"Beyoutifull in its simplicity and overwhelming by its long and complex history. Inside you can get an interesting view on what life could have looked like back in the days of the birth of modern portugal. Every room in the castle holds priceless artifacts of days past, walking through the tall arched halls and decorated rooms you can se countless vases, rugs, desks and miscellaneous objects often hand crafted by artisans and masters long forgotten by the public.  A true must see."
Cēsis History and Art Museum,Greg Kondrasuk,4,"The castle and museum are connected as part of the same attraction, although you can get tickets for each separately or combined.  We did the combo ticket and really enjoyed the castle, but were a bit disappointed with the museum.  I'd give the castle 5 stars and the museum 3 stars.  The castle grounds have some great vantage points for taking photos of the castle itself.  The tour through the castle is very well done as well, with placards in Latvian and English.  They also have several multimedia displays and videos with English subtitles.  The interior staircases of the towers are not lit and they offer real candle lanterns to help navigate, which was fun.  The top of the tallest tower features a very well done video that is projected onto the walls and doorways and shows a rolling history through time of the castle.  The museum is in the new castle building and was a bit disappointing.  The lights for the displays were not working for several exhibits and most of the items on display had their placards only in Latvian.  One of their computer monitor interactive displays was also not functioning. The museum has exhibits about the construction of the castle, the history of Latvia, and some model rooms as they would have been when they were in use.  There is a nice view of Cesis from the open top of the tower at the end of the tour route."
Cēsis History and Art Museum,Artis Grizāns,5,This is a very vast museum on multiple floors with several permanent and special exhibitions. Very vell worth the visit alone or combining woth a visit to a nearby medieval castle.
Cēsis History and Art Museum,Jason La Roche,5,"Great Historic location, previous visitors include the Teutonic Knights, Ivan the Terrible and the Napoleonic army. Would come back again during the summer. The staff running the location were absolutely amazing and informative."
Cēsis History and Art Museum,Rui Xiong,5,"Had a great experience exploring the castle. There are many things in the castle, worth the admission price. Highly recommend visiting the old castle."
Cēsis History and Art Museum,Darina Sa,4,"Well, the museum didn't live up to my expectations, plus, I got a bit angry when I found out that I had to pay the museum entrance fee to see the castle :( bit I really liked the town of Cesi."
Hotel St. Florian,Przemysław Jara,5,"Awesome beer, nice atmosphere, worth to take a sit whenever ure in Loket."
Hotel St. Florian,RadyS,5,Opulentni snidane. ♡
Hotel St. Florian,Christine W.,5,"Super cute hotel. The rooms are stylishly furnished. Everything lovingly furnished, even with German TV. The bed was a bit hard for me personally, but that's a matter of taste. Small bathroom with a large shower. However, there are probably other rooms that have a very small shower, we were told by our tour group.  Great breakfast. Nicely located in the small town, all very historical."
Hotel St. Florian,Anna Krausová,5,"The accommodation met my expectations, excellent location and place. Concerts at the castle are top notch. Only a cobweb remained in the room, and not just one. The lady from the hotel and I sorted it out ;). Thank you for the accommodation and hopefully I will visit here again sometime in the future."
Hotel St. Florian,Robbsen González Blanco,4,"Rooms are okay, since you're out and about all the time anyway, they are completely sufficient for overnight stays. Otherwise everything clean & tidy."
Książ Castle,KJK Ravi Teja,5,"We just visited the castle from outside as we didn't have enough time to go for a tour. There's an individual or combined ticket for castle, palm house and the undergrounds. Car parking is not free after the security guard, unless you're visiting the castle hotel. You can park it in the open parking space before the security guard for free. There is an ice cream shop near the castle which is a necessity in hot summers. Not sure if there's any restaurant though. There's a small vertical sprinkler through which you can go to refresh yourself in hot weather. You can visit Viewpoint too, which is a small walk type trek for 15 minutes. There's a fresh corn stick seller, each for 8 PLN. You can bring park stuff (mats, food, play items etc) also for relaxation. There are a lot of gardens and you can sit anywhere. The place is definitely worth a day trip."
Książ Castle,Valeria Drobot,5,"The price of the ticket is worth paying. Huge area to see. They gave an audio guide that automatically switches while you changing different halls. The audio guide is available in a few foreign languages. Parking is overpriced: next to Castle the price is 30 pln, further - 20 pln. And when you enter the castle there is a toilet with an entrance fee - 5 pln, which in my humble opinion should be included in the price of the ticket. Overall it is a great place to spend a day with a family or loved ones."
Książ Castle,Oleksandr Protsenko,5,"Castle Ksiaz... there are a lot of things which I can write here about this castle. But surely it is just impossible to tell all interesting things about this castle here.... it is much better to open Wiki or other sources and read, there is a lot of interesting information including medieval history,  Hitler's ""golden trains"" and many others. Or  you must come, take an audio guide (included into entrance fee) and see & listen....  there are a lot of very interesting stories, there are many unsolved secrets even now.  Enjoy the castle, the subterranean, the magical terraces..."
Książ Castle,Courtney Adams,5,Wonderful tour with audio guides in English and Polish. Was amazing to see the historical castle and get an in depth overview of the origins and family that ruled. The castle is also photo friendly so you can take some amazing photos around the interior and exterior of the castle. I would definitely visit it again.
Książ Castle,Jaroslaw Sawicki,5,"Very nice and interesting place.  Beautiful interiors and terraces.  I also recommend the underground route, very interesting and mysterious"
Salgói vár,Péter Kajtár,5,"After a nice little hike from the parking the view that the ruin can offer is spectacular, perfect for romantic sunsets. We wished if it would have been preserved in better condition but you still feel the history. Thumbs up for Petőfi."
Salgói vár,Thomas William Walsh,5,Excelent view to the land. The place is in a relatively good condition. The road up is okay.
Salgói vár,Jennifer B,5,"Amazing view from the top! The castle went through on a renovation, the highest tower got a roof. Parking is 1,7km from the castle, so it is easily accessible with children too. Follow the green T tourist sign for 1,5km, you will get to the ""carved squirrel"". From here 0,3km more on red L. The last 20 steps a bit high, but the rest of the trail is a nice walk. If you are in the area make sure you don't miss the witch's stones! Only 0,3km from the ""carved squirrel"". ;)"
Salgói vár,Kornél Dénes,5,Amazing view! Unmissable uniqe place.
Salgói vár,Ivan Jakubs,5,Loved the hike. Loved the view from the hill tower! A must visit spot if you’re in the area and exploring the north
Läckö Castle,R Stunetii,5,Fascinating and well-kept castle. I especially enjoyed being able to casually visit some of the rooms in the courtyard area without being part of a guided tour. I especially liked the armoury. The gardens were beautiful.
Läckö Castle,Shawna J.,5,"This was our favorite castle to tour. The other castles were glitz and glamour. This one was beautiful and unique artwork. If I read that on a review, I'd probably pass on this castle thinking it was boring. It's not boring at all. It's amazing."
Läckö Castle,adam lee,5,"If you are looking for a beautiful picturesque location, history and Fika near Lidköping this is the place to visit. There is plenty of history to learn about the castle, and the views are amazing. Small coffee shop just outside of the castle with great Fika with great prices, too."
Läckö Castle,Ted Williams,5,"Awesome historic adventure. Beautiful, interesting views inside and out. Tour was given by gentleman explaining details about entire castle."
Läckö Castle,Catrin Abrahamsson-Beynon,5,"Lovely castle and history, wonderful cafe and the fine restaurant Naturum."
Castle Stalker,Jerald Kng,5,"Castle clearly not accessible, there’s a small parking area around the garbage bins, after that can take a stroll towards the water body and along the rocky beach, or can follow the cycling path until there’s an entrance in! Glad to be able to see this and capture some nice shots"
Castle Stalker,Gwion Hughes,4,Nice view and delicious cafe overlooking the castle but i was unable to find a path to get near the castle
Castle Stalker,Conor Hennessy Sykes,5,"Amazing old castle which seems to be in the process of being restored, it’s out in the loch on an island of its own so can only be accessed by a pre-arranged tour I believe. Nonetheless, I think it’s absolutely worth visiting to view the castle and surrounding areas from the shore of the mainland if you are nearby."
Castle Stalker,LauraGrace Roaming Hind,5,You have to park near some big refuse bins and walk a short distance down a cycle path to get this view over a fence
Castle Stalker,Marc Cawood,5,"Amazingly beautiful, lonely and picturesque spot. Ignore the unwelcoming signage around the garbage collection area, park and have a look."
Arundel Castle,Julia Damtoft,5,"Great castle, great views. I was very surprised, it looks like it was built last year, it's in such good condition. Lots to see on the inside, the staff are lovely. Gardens are very symmetrical so it seems all the same, but very nice nonetheless. Beautiful cathedral, nice facilities. I was a bit taken aback by the price, it cost us £50 just for my partner and I to go into the castle. It was the most expensive castle we have ever visited! But I would pay that any day to see the look on my partner's face, he loved all the architecture and woodwork. £2.50 for up to 4 hours in the car park on Mill Rd, pretty good rate. The staff knew the answers to most of the questions we had, and were quite lovely and friendly. The town itself has some nice antique stores as well."
Arundel Castle,Gary Dickinson,5,"This is a beautiful castle, with superb gardens. The best time to go is when they have their tulip festival!!! However still a wonderful day out any other time, the town close by has plenty of restaurants/cafes/pubs etc to eat."
Arundel Castle,Daren Warburton,5,"Fantastic day out for all the family, plenty going on with history tours, face painting, medieval games and archery/ axe throwing. You can also dress up in period clothing and also complete the outfit with shield and sword Fantastic day well worth it. Plus if you want to ask anything about the place there are people in every room who are all to happy to help 😊"
Arundel Castle,Andy Lord,5,"Absolutely amazing place. Not only are the grounds themselves amazing and larger than expected, the tour around the moat and defences and viewing the rooms inside makes for a very interesting and enjoyable day for all. You'll need more time that you'd expect to fit it all in."
Arundel Castle,Arun Joy,4,Beautiful Castle which has been very well maintained with loads of history within it's Walls. 10 min walk from the railway station and entry costs 27 pounds for Castle and Gardens. Takes about 2-3 hours to see the whole place. Great views of surrounding areas from the keep and luxurious rooms. The Gardens are are delight too. Perfect for a day trip.
Castell Carreg Cennen,Matt Dedman,5,"Great views and amenities. The scones in the shop are delightful.  Bring a torch for the cave, it's worth it, just watch your head!  The small entry fee is definitely worth seeing the Castle. Plenty to see and stunning views too."
Castell Carreg Cennen,joel rees-price,5,"Amazing place well worth a visit, starting with the lovely cafe and gift shop, the ladies were so lovely and happily talked with my boys then lets talk cake it was so good it was an emotional experience level good, rhubarb crumble cake warm with ice cream a must and inside the cafe is incredible to look at. Then best walking boots on up to a brilliant castle ruin with stunning views and a cave that has to be seen 5 stats not enough for this"
Castell Carreg Cennen,Clare Sheppard Gale,5,"Nice walk around the castle, free car park, £6.50 entry for adults. Lots of sheep so careful if you have a dog. Lovely views, able to go into the castle cave underneath the castle. Nice visit. Also a cafe at the bottom of the hill with toilets. The car park gets locked at 6pm."
Castell Carreg Cennen,N M,5,"A great spot. £6.80 admission fee (adult), beautiful views from the top. Did the 'yellow' (shorter) walking route - a little anticlimactic, but the castle, views and cave (underground passage running below the castle - silent, dark and not for the faint-hearted!) were fantastic. Recommend. (Also - the ladies in the café very kindly refilled my water bottle - thank you!)"
Castell Carreg Cennen,Jackie Driscoll,5,"Great castle high up on the mountain, with old walls still remaining down in the bowels of the castle still able to explore, but you'll need torchlight to go to the bottom, need good shoes and really slippery and uneven. Excellent views from the top of the surrounding countryside x Also an amazing restaurant over looking the mountain with a fully stocked bar (didnt use the restaurant this time) and a wonderful welsh gift shop. You can just visit the restaurant and gift shop, only have to pay for the castle x"
Castle La Mota,Duncan Parsons,5,An impressive building. Plenty of free parking. Good way to finish a day in Medina del Campo.
Castle La Mota,Louati Aymen,5,"Castillo de la Mota is a historic castle located in the town of Medina del Campo, province of Valladolid, Spain. Built in the 14th century, this castle plays an important role in the history and culture of Spain."
Castle La Mota,Paweł Kranzberg,5,"An innovative - for its time - XV century castle. Impressive from the outside, while the interior recreated in the XX century is a bit meh."
Castle La Mota,Jim De Mauro,4,"Well, we slept through our stop on the train and arrived in Medina del Campo, and there wasn't going to be another train for 4 hours.  So we spent the day here, visited the castle and walked into town to see the plaza and have lunch.  The castle was delightful and the town square was realistically presented, as a town square and not a tourist trap.  we had a lot of fun!"
Castle La Mota,Geoff Berg,5,One of the best castles I have visited in Spain. We did the underground tour which was amazing. The castle itself is well kept and beautifully restored
Malbork Castle,Roman Trach,5,"Google doesn't have enough stars for me to rate this castle. It is very large and truly a city within a city. At least minimum 4 hours to go through the whole castle. The audio guide is well thought out, very interesting to listen to. Learning history with him and walking around the castle is just great. This is the best castle I have seen in my life, I was very impressed."
Malbork Castle,M J,5,"Great place to visit. We took the 3,5 h tour with family discount. We chose to buy our tickets at the ticket machine but would by tickets online next time, because you have to wait a little time. You mustn’t take the tour with the guide, even though it seems to be very good. But we chose to go alone because it was the right choice for us with small children. Wasn’t that easy with a stroller but you can leave it if you want in the yard of the castle. We recommend the extra trip on the top of the tower for 12 zloty. You will have a decent view. The audio guide is very informative. All together it’s a beautiful castle. The restaurant next to the riverside is also very nice."
Malbork Castle,Pau Daczkowska,5,"That was the best family visit of this holiday.with my 6 and 8 years old we did an audio family tour. They love it . As my little one said: I thought it would be boring but it was super fun, I can come everyday! Recommend to buy tickets online"
Malbork Castle,Farhad Iskandarov,5,"The Malbork Castle is an incredible sight to behold. It is the largest brick castle in the world, and its size and grandeur are truly awe-inspiring. The castle was built by the Teutonic Order in the 13th century, and it served as their headquarters for over 200 years. Today, the castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination.  I visited the Malbork Castle this summer, and I was blown away by its beauty and historical significance. The castle is divided into three sections: the High Castle, the Middle Castle, and the Lower Castle. Each section has its own unique charm, and it is fascinating to explore them all.  I highly recommend visiting the Malbork Castle if you are ever in Poland. It is a truly unforgettable experience."
Malbork Castle,Taja Zuozaitė,5,"Amazing castle to visit. Would really recommend buying the tickets online beforehand as the lines for the tickets get quite long. That being said it is an amazing castle and they have audio guides in several different languages including English, Polish, German, Lithuanian and more! The audio guides are excellent, the whole tour takes around 3 hours."
Rock of Cashel,Stephanie G,5,This didn't disappoint. We didn't do a tour or anything we just walked around ourselves. But the grounds were breathtaking and it wasn't that busy during the week. We were blessed with good weather and I was so glad we did this stop
Rock of Cashel,Robyn,5,"Interesting place to stop by. The real attraction isn't the ruins but the sweeping vistas all around. It did rain while we were there, but waiting it out proved to be a huge boon as the skies cleared up for magnificent photo taking opportunities."
Rock of Cashel,Joerg Feigl,5,"Mystique place on the top of a hill, just 5 min. walk from parking lot. Chapel can not be visited at the moment due to renovation. Beautiful view to the green Irish hills"
Rock of Cashel,Alan Spain,5,"Lovely walks around the cathedral, steeped in history, the audio room is great to learn about the cathedral and surrounding area. Kids also go free. After pop down to granny’s kitchen for a cuppa tea and a slice of cake."
Rock of Cashel,Dr. W. Sennebogen,4,"This is a must see location when in Ireland. The place is full of history and very famous. Try to avoid the bus tours flooding the place in the morning. Enjoy the majestic ruins, the Celtic Crosses of the graveyard and the view from the hill where it is built."
Visegrádi fellegvár,Laszlo Elekes,5,"This place must be visited if you are in this area. The view is stunning! We took the bus from Visegrád and after we visited the castle, we got back to the city by foot, through the forest (it's a 25 minutes walk)."
Visegrádi fellegvár,L. Miska,5,"The castle is not that big,one hour walk more or less...But the vibe is very nice and the view is makes up for everything what the castle does not provide.The river Danube is just beautiful from here especially at summer.If you are nearby definitely you have to come here,worth it...The entry is cheap.There is also nice toilett for free.A little panopticon is inside where we can get a glimpse of its contemporary life.There is a not that big carpark aswell in front of the castle.Restaurants,souvenir shops are here too..."
Visegrádi fellegvár,Orki Bib,4,"Fantastic views and a nice place to walk by and see the fortress itself. There's a catapult inside, and some other knights equipment (sword, shield, etc.) 1-2 hours is enough."
Visegrádi fellegvár,Gizella Juhasz,5,"Spectacular view of the Danube! Lots of walking is involved but well worth it! Parking is also available...right by the castle or a few hundred meters away. There are cute vendors for food, ice cream and beverages. Using the public toilette facility will cost you 200 Ft."
Visegrádi fellegvár,Anirban Majumdar,5,"The place is simply amazing. The panoramic view from the top is magnificent. We hiked from the bus stop ""nagymarosi rév"". Not an easy hike, but it's not that long either. To go uphill, it takes less than an hour. And the trail is very well indicated. One could also possibly reach by bus, but check the timing."
Castle of Lousã,Kiana Sanajou,5,"Cool tiny castle in the middle of stunning nature in Lousa. Not overly much to see, but the setting is stunning with the sound of water from down below in the gorge. There is a nice resting platform behind the castle. We loved the little settlement at the bottom, and the views all round are amazing."
Castle of Lousã,Alessio Solar,4,"Nice little castle immersed in nature and not too far from the Talasnal hamlet. Nothing too impressive, but well kept, well connected, has a nice view and it's free. If you happen to be around you can stop for a look. Won't hurt"
Castle of Lousã,Jude Bischoff,4,The Castle was cool and the hiking was spectacular. We climbed 1500 ft elevation through centuries old villages. Do this hike if you can.
Castle of Lousã,Artur Victoria,5,"Also known as Arouce Castle, it belongs to one of the first defensive lines created to control the southern access to Coimbra in the second half of the 11th century. In the early days of the monarchy, the town played an important role, which was not oblivious to its status as border village. In 1124, an Islamic foray took the castle and, again in the possession of Portucalense County, was awarded charter in 1151 by D. Afonso Henriques. According to an ancient legend, at the time of the Muslim occupation the castle was erected by Emir (Arab boss) Aruge, to protect his daughter Peralta and his treasures after being defeated and expelled by Conimbriga."
Castle of Lousã,Roman Roaming Around,4,"Nice little castle not too far from the city, 30 min walk, and at the trailhead to hike to the schist villages. A good place to learn a little more about Portugal history"
Sortelha Parish Council,Not Our Planet,5,"It’s unique place, love it"
Sortelha Parish Council,Belita Isabel Janeira,4,"Sortelha, topped by a castle that stands out in the landscape. Houses and cottages are highly regarded and have beautiful curtains on the windows, which give them a certain grace in contrast to the rigidity of the stone. Handicraft shop inviting to enter and observe the typical local products up close. Very well preserved village with adequate infrastructure for visitors."
Sortelha Parish Council,Adriana Clauz,5,"Sortelha Castle is located in the village of the same name, in the municipality of Sabugal, in the district of Guarda, in Portugal.  Built on a granite massif in a dominant position over the Riba-Côa valley, the crossing area between the Iberian Meseta and the depression of Cova da Beira, it is part of what is considered one of the best preserved Historic Villages of Beira Interior.  At the time of the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Pena Sortelha, as it was then called, was established in defense of the border region, disputed between Portugal and Castile. From 1187, D. Sancho I (1185-1211) took measures to repopulate the place, and it was his homonymous grandson, D. Sancho II, who granted the town's charter (1228), probably when the castle was built. In the 13th century, King Dinis benefited from the fence around the village, who, after signing the Treaty of Alcanises (1297), set the borders beyond the lands of Riba-Côa. In the following century, a new fence was built on the initiative of D. Fernando.  In the 15th century it is known that the mayor of the castle was Manuel Sardinha, succeeding him Pêro Zuzarte.  In 1510, D. Manuel I (1495-1521) renewed the town's charter, mentioning that its inhabitants were not obliged to provide accommodation to the great and small of the kingdom, if that was the will of the people of Sortelha. This sovereign also started a campaign of works in the castle, among which the emblematic Manueline over the door remains. In 1522 Garcia Zuzarte became mayor. In that century, the noble D. Luís da Silveira, chief guard of D. Manuel I and D. João III (1521-1557), acquired the castle, becoming its mayor, granting it D. João III the title of Count of Sortelha."
Sortelha Parish Council,Paulo Machado,4,"Beautiful place... it seems that we are in the medieval era, with magnificent scenery, I advise you to visit."
Sortelha Parish Council,MANUdias,5,"Fantastic and wonderful battlements of this castle, where the dwellings of yesteryear are extremely well preserved... still with some inhabitants."
Lighthouse of Peñiscola,Vladimir Balaz,5,"Not big one, but very nice."
Lighthouse of Peñiscola,lunavf_4,5,"Very nice on the outside, and although I didn't visit the inside because you have to pay, I am guessing it is beautiful too. It's located right next to the Castle which means to get there you need to walk up hill for a bit 😜 but it's worth seeing."
Lighthouse of Peñiscola,Guyver II,5,"Lighthouse located just under the Castle. Was inaugurated in 1899 with the light fueled by paraffin, then subsequently oil. Electricity arrived in 1929 and the last update was in 1970. Interesting that the light can be seen up to 23 nautical miles away."
Lighthouse of Peñiscola,無名,5,"I know I said I wouldn't do anymore, but I wrote your review on TripAdvisor. Did you read it yet?"
Lighthouse of Peñiscola,Edwin T,5,Mesmerising… perhaps having sunrise/sunset tours at the lighthouse will be a great idea (not to make the area more touristy…)
Bled Castle Museum,Diptanshu Jaiswal,4,"Museum is located inside the Bled Castle and the entry price is part of the 15 Euro which you pay for adult entry of Bled castle. Small and good museum with Bled Castle history and ages. Old stones,  weapons and bonse are on display. Small rooms with self service and guidance is posted nearby each display. Good for you if you are interested in history."
Bled Castle Museum,Rommel Manzano,5,It was fun and enjoy the sightseeing. We take a boat to reach the little island on the lake. And there is a cathedral on the island and they said that if you go inside you will see a rope and rang the bell 5x and make a wish. After the island we gather around we make our way to the castle. There is a balcony to see the lake and the panoramic view of the place
Bled Castle Museum,Brian Albury,5,"Pretty, and pretty interesting if you read the stuff in the museum, and some really old artifacts."
Bled Castle Museum,Ekaterina A,5,Good place to see! Little bit boring but view is nice. Price for entering the castle 13 euro
Bled Castle Museum,Christina Lu,4,We drove up here trying to get to the baths but decided to check out the castle too. It was right when it was closing so not sure if this would be different if you came during their open/peak hours. We had free parking and were able to walk all around the inside of the castle too for free. Stunning views of Lake Bled. We couldn't go inside the museums or castle itself but the views were really nice and worth it. Down below you see the roped off area for swimming.
Spiš Castle,Lukasz De,5,Castle is huge. In My opinion it looks best from outside. At least currently as the most interesting upper part inside is closed due to renovation and hence the tickets are at 50% discount. The castle is very easily accessible by car. You can come with dog as well. Inside well equipped bar.
Spiš Castle,Noémi Jánvári,5,One of the largest castles in Central Europe 🏰 Stands beautifully on the hill. Unfortunately at this time you can’t visit the upper (and the biggest) part of the castle due to ongoing renovations. Hence the entry fee is half price. But you can walk around on the surrounding walls and the massive garden. You can also watch a few minutes of VR video for 50 cents. It’s worth it. I’m looking forward to return when the renovations are complete.
Spiš Castle,Ryan V,5,"This historic castle sits atop a hill that overlooks a large valley on all sides, with mountains in the distance. The castle was being restored when I visited, but much of it was still open, and the price was heavily discounted. I walked the grounds and on top of the perimeter wall and was able to get many pictures of the beautiful surrounding landscape. I highly recommend a visit here. The kids loved it as well."
Spiš Castle,Dániel Koppa,3,I don't recommend visiting now as the highcastle is under reconstruction. Additionally there are only handful of exhibitions and at the time of our visit no particular programmes. Still it's a beautiful place for an afternoon.
Spiš Castle,Felix Heuer,5,"Definitely a sight you have to see when you are travelling the High Tatras in Slovakia. Impressive castle complex and amazing photo spot.  Parking can be a bit tricky since there are not many spots available on the official parking lot. However, you can also park next to the street further down the hill.  There are bathrooms and a little shop available within the castle complex.  !!! Attention, July 2023: The inner part of the castle is currently under construction and cannot be accessed. Nonetheless, the castle is still worth a visit !!!"
Fénis Castle,P. C.,3,"I think this castle is good to see if 1) you’ve never seen a castle in person before, or 2) you’re under the age of 10.  As English speakers, we took the only tour available which was in Italian (I don’t mind; I’m practicing).  There is sufficient signage in English in each room we visited to get a sense of what we were seeing, plus we were handed a pamphlet that was partially in English.  Even with all of that, Fenis castle just felt underwhelming—and not really worth the €9 each (castle only, no museum).  A lot of what we saw was reproduction, approximately as old (from the period), or not from the original castle.  Additionally, after the guided tour (you cannot look independently), we were invited to walk around the outside of the castle, but could not explore the inside any further.  That was disappointing.  I’ve seen several European castles, and this one felt like a toy in comparison, and lacked rich historical information at the site (I understood most of what was said in Italian—just no ‘juicy’ facts to make the guided tour interesting).  The guide was very nice, and didn’t hurry our group so everyone could take pictures. It was just an okay tourist stop."
Fénis Castle,Kristiina Vuolukka,4,"Beautiful ancient place and serene surroundings! We did not visit The Castle as it closed for siesta, but enjoyed having a picnic lunch on the park surrounding The Castle. March, week 12."
Fénis Castle,Toomas Kull,3,"Beautiful castle from the outside. But if you don’t speak Italian and have young children, it’s not worth visiting inside. You can only visit with an Italian guide, at allocated time slots. You’ll end up staring at empty rooms and reading descriptions of the random bits of furniture collected from random parts of Italy. You’ll wonder: did they ever think about the non-Italian visitor experience? Towards the end your kids will hate you slightly, and you’ll start planning your escape. Like, when is it appropriate to just sneak out so the tour guide doesn’t notice? Walking outside the castle is nice. There is a walking path that goes up towards the mountain through the fields from where you can take awesome photos. Walk further up and through the village above the castle and you’ll get some more nice views. If you’re here just before lunch time, you’re in luck - trattoria de bourg is worth going to for the tasty food."
Fénis Castle,Jarrod Hunt,5,"Honestly one of the best castles we've ever been to, including about 100 in England. Amazing furniture, frescoes, rooms, signage and the building itself is gorgeous. The crowning glory though is the courtyard, what a beauty it is!"
Fénis Castle,Fraser Mckay,4,"Really enjoyed the visit with lots of frescos and great views.Although you have to go on a tour of the castle with an Italian speaking guide, there is a lot of Information in English."
Castle Gormaz,Mauro Izquierdo,5,"It's an amazing castle, it's unbelievable that it still has so many parts of it in good shape after almost 1000 years, kudos to the government of Soria to keep it as beautiful as it is."
Castle Gormaz,Dan Littauer,5,"What a stunning Arab castle. This was once the biggest fortification defending the caliphate from the Christian Kings who repeatedly tried to raid the sophisticated Muslim civilisation. In fact it was a small fortified town with the Alcazar (governor fortress) attached to it. Highly recommend, breathtaking views to the surrounding countryside."
Castle Gormaz,Kim GoDive,5,"A link with history. Once muslim citadel and fortress, biggest in Europe.  Placed over a small hill with incredible views all around. River Duero at its feet. The ruins of its long walls give a glimpse of what it was t the time. Open access."
Castle Gormaz,Chris Hardy,5,What an amazing place. Anyone who fails to be moved by it should check their pulse!
Castle Gormaz,Mat Adams,5,A rare opportunity to see unspoiled history.  A photo can not describe this place.  Go there.
Boldogkő Castle,Jaroslav Mida,5,"Really enjoyed the castle trip. Beautiful, older castle, set on the hill. A lot of tourists come here, better come earlier during the day. Entry is very cheap, though corresponds to the fact there are very few guide points to tell the story of this castle. The visit takes around 1 hr."
Boldogkő Castle,Attila (Attila de Tour),4,"Very well restored castle. Probably one of the better ones out of the 20 located in modern Hungary. There is a reasonable entry fee  but so much to see. There are live shows showing knights sword fighting and some attendants in medieval costumes. The views from here are spectacular. Highly recommended. One note to mention though, everything is written and spoken in Hungarian so have a translator app available if you don't speak the language. May be a bit challenging to navigate by elderly or those with mobility issues. Still worth a visit just for the views as the castle is located on a steep hill."
Boldogkő Castle,Kriszta K Tubbs,5,"This medieval fort is from the 13th century and is very educational. Some of the rooms are well furnished, and some of them have exhibitions of weapons or tin soldiers. The view is fantastic since it stands on the highly steep ridge of the Zemplen Mountains. Get your hiking shoes because the walkways are not even and are very rocky."
Boldogkő Castle,Panna Mama,5,It is a fantastic place! You can learn about history and walk among the old walls. Stunning view. Great coffee place by the entrance.
Boldogkő Castle,Peter Seno,5,"An excellent tip for a weekend trip with family, children or friends. The nicely renovated castle offers an excellent view of the surroundings. Exposition appropriate to the size of the castle. There is free parking directly below the castle, from which it is a short walk to the castle.  If you are planning a visit, check the opening hours in advance.  There is a nice viewing terrace with a cafe near the parking lot under the castle. And I can't fail to mention the medieval restaurant where you can have a great meal.  I appreciate the possibility to pay by card in the castle and in the cafe and restaurant."
Národní Památkový Ústav,David Šauer,5,👍
Caerphilly Castle,M. YILDIRIM,5,"Caerphilly Castle is an absolute must-visit! This historical gem left me truly impressed. The castle's impressive architecture, rich history, and stunning surroundings create an unforgettable experience.  Caerphilly Castle is a remarkable testament to Welsh history and architecture. Whether you're a history enthusiast or just looking for a captivating outing, this castle won't disappoint.  Note: There is a car park close to the castle."
Caerphilly Castle,frankie Beckett,5,"I had an amazing time at this castle, me and my partner were given free entry as I'm in a wheelchair and unable to access anywhere there are stairs. I had such a great time exploring the grounds and took so many photos! highly recommend visiting here!"
Caerphilly Castle,John 3v16,5,Easy parking although it wasn't school holidays. The Castle was interesting and fun to explore. Lovely walk around the castle...loads of ducks and birds. Great day out.
Caerphilly Castle,Adam Curtis,5,"Lovely to visit. A fair amount to see and read. Not too bad for price, especially offering NHS discount. Some lovely views from near the top. Unfortunately some of the areas were closed when we visited, but by way of apology, they gave us a free guidebook which was a really kind gesture and was really informative."
Caerphilly Castle,Laura Dufton,5,"A very good castle. Probably the best one in Wales. There are some restoration works going on inside the main area of the castle. Unfortunately unable to see all areas of the castle. But they have done a great job in opening what they can to allow you to see everything possible. The castle is dog friendly on ground floor levels only. If you're going alone with your dog, I would recommend waiting 1 and a half years til the restoration is completed."
Loarre Castle,Jarrod Hunt,5,"Seriously awesome castle. One of my top top castles I've visited. The view is spectacular, the audio guide very good, and the castle itself is very intricate and well preserved. DO NOT MISS!"
Loarre Castle,Carlos Eduardo Marín Sánchez,5,This place is just amazing... be sure you have the time to visit with a guide and you will learn so very much about romanic architecture and medieval times! Also the view and landscape are breathtaking
Loarre Castle,Carlos Contreras,5,"Loarre Castle is a medieval fortress located in the province of Huesca, Spain. It is perched on a rocky hill overlooking the surrounding landscape, offering breathtaking views of the Pyrenees Mountains. Dating back to the 11th century, Loarre Castle is known for its well-preserved Romanesque architecture."
Loarre Castle,Robert Zywno,5,I recommend taking the tour as it was very entertaining and interesting. The place is like no other. Seems like from a dungeon computers game. The views are spectacular as well.
Loarre Castle,RER,4,"As we were driving up the mountain, I was thinking about not going because it was it around 3:30, getting into the fog/clouds, have good views of it and just didn't think we'd enjoy it as much. I was wrong. However, I was disappointed with the audio tour because it was very short and we had some difficulties understanding where to look and what was being explained."
Dunnottar Castle,Adam Strelec,5,The climactic approach to the castle and the experience on the castle grounds were both equally memorable. Grounds and many features of the castle are well preserved and signs detailing information about areas within the castle grounds were clear and detailed. Recommend a coastal walk either before or after the castle tour too because in my opinion you can get more breathtaking views of the castle as you walk in the direction of the war memorial away from the castle.
Dunnottar Castle,Filip Malinowski,4,"Beautiful, that's for sure. Only loses done charm because of so many people. Worth seeing, but in the region there is a bunch of equally beautiful and more explorable castle ruins with free access."
Dunnottar Castle,Doug D.,5,"Words cannot describe the beauty and serenity of Dunnottar Castle! 360 degree views, stunning landscape. If you're a fan of ruins then it's an absolute gem!  One thing to note is the trek into the castle is quite extreme, so kids and elderly should take extra care. Also it's not disability-friendly."
Dunnottar Castle,Petar Dimitrov,5,"One of the top place i ever visit. There is a bit of a walk from parking till the castle. A long staircase down and up the hill to the castle,it's definitely not accessible at all, but if you can do the stairs its worth to visit! Area near down the castle with lots if sea shells.Parking is free but is mostly packed so better to go early or you can park along the street."
Dunnottar Castle,Gavin McKie,5,"An excellent historical attraction that’s obviously well maintained by the owners. A lot of care has been taken to set up informative signs and exhibits to give an insight into the history and development of the site.  As an attraction it’s obviously very busy during tourist season so be prepared for crowds in some of the smaller areas of the site.  Obviously it goes without saying that a medieval castle positioned on a lump of rock in the North Sea is not suitable for wheelchairs, prams, pushchairs or those with limited mobility."
Caernarfon Castle,Ben Coulthard,5,"£40 for a family ticket is good value,  but what you should do is buy the 3 day ticket which allows you into several castles for only £56. Caernarfon was great for a good half day visit and staff member Edward was so very helpful and should get a pay rise!"
Caernarfon Castle,Jef Henninger,5,"Caernarfon Castle Caernarfon, Wales  This massive castle from the late 1200s was a lot of fun to check out.  Just like one of the castles we went to yesterday, you can walk all around on your own.  From climbing up steep steps to get on top of the tallest tower to walking down dark passageways, there's just something about exploring amazing castles.  It took us over an hour to see everything we wanted to see and that was even with skipping a few parts as we much have walked up and down over 200 steps.  There's a museum dedicated to Welsh soldiers in one section of the castle which was pretty interesting to check out.  The views from the towers are incredible and you can clearly see what an amazing fortress this would have been back then.  Highly recommended."
Caernarfon Castle,Joanne Bonworth,5,Fantastic place for all the family to visit. Staff were so helpful and it now has more accessable areas for people with disabilities or prams. U can come and go on a day ticket. We spent a little time in the morning looking round then went to see some of the town before returning later on. Well worth the cost of entry. Best castle we have visited so far.
Caernarfon Castle,BeFit Cornwall,5,"We had a lovely visit to the castle today! Our 5 year old loved it 😊 So much to explore, the museum and information displays were great. Really loved how the castle has been updated, a perfect blend of the original castle and modern features such as wooden seating, art installations and glass windows. We were really surprised by how much of the castle you can explore. Lush views from the top. Would definitely recommend!"
Caernarfon Castle,Simon Stepsys,5,"Fabulous medieval castle 🏰 with superb museum, cafe, shop, toilets, coffee bar.  Fantastic views, over the sea and the countryside.  Definitely worth a visit.  Take your time exploring, we spent about 2 hours touring round the magnificent castle."
Gropparello Castle,Rosa Helena Greiffenstein,4,"We booked the package of dinner and tour which was expensive and when we got there we realized you can eat in their restaurant without the tour, something their page didn't offer. Food was good quality but it's important to know that drinks are not included, not even water. After having a big dinner and a bottle of wine it was a struggle to do the hour and a half tour, which started at 10.30 and finished at midnight"
Gropparello Castle,Vittorio Robecchi,5,The guided tour was full of history-related notions about the Castle and its territory. The owner is very passionate and absolutely loves his job. Very welcoming. Recommened.
Gropparello Castle,Saša Božić,5,Amazing and very preserved place. Learning something about the place you are visiting in Italy is a must. Curator was very pleasant and funny but unfortunately all tour was on Italian and with out explanations on other languages.
Gropparello Castle,Fabio C.,5,"That is a gorgeous place with such a friendly staff that you might want to stay in there like forever.  Perfect for a family day out, or for a luxury weekend.  If you can manage to stay overnight go for the full experience.  It's worth every single cent."
Gropparello Castle,IDEANA MAKE UP,5,A lovely place lost in the Piacenza Valley in the middle of Italy. A medieval experience. Delicious food and wonderful location.
Middleham Castle,Leigh Bosworth,4,"Pretty well preserved. I know people need somewhere to get a snack and a drink, but the cafe being so close to the castle seems a bit out of place.  Anyway, great to see it both from on top of the hill approach and close up, at the end of our 6 Dales Trail walk 🚶‍♂️"
Middleham Castle,Jonathan Newis,5,The castle is a lovely day trip out. With a little shop and friendly staff it was a really plesant day. With a tower to climb and plenty of boards to read about the history of the castle there enough to do. As well as being located at the top of the little village so can walk down and have some lunch or a drink I'm the village. Parking right next to the castle is tight but plenty of parking around the village in a close walking distance. We will be going again.
Middleham Castle,Gill Nash,5,"Huge castle ruins, lots to see and plenty to explore and climb around. They had toys, colouring and dress up for the little ones, familes playing hide n seek and a few of us wandering round exploring. If you visit don’t miss the spiral stairs ti the ground floor of the keep and to the top of the walls for a fabulous view"
Middleham Castle,Richard,5,Stopped for a quick visit on the way up to the Forbidden Corner. Nice castle with good views from the tall tower.
Middleham Castle,steven batty,5,"A lovely castle to walk around. The place is steeped in history. The great tower or keep was probably built in the 1170s. The clue to this date lies in the carved stone capitals in the chapel in the north-east corner of the keep (now inaccessible), which have ‘waterleaf’ decoration – a form of carving known to have been used elsewhere in Yorkshire in the second half of the 12th century.  The most notable owners of the castle were Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick who helped put Edward IV on the throne at Towton in 1461.  The Duke of Gloucester was also part of the Middleham household and following Warwick's death in 1471 the lands were given to Richard.  Richard became Protector of the Realm upon Edward IV’s death in 1483. Later that year he was crowned Richard III, usurping his 12-year-old nephew, Edward V. Richard continued to spend time at Middleham, staying there for several days in 1484 after his son, Edward, died at the castle.  On the defeat of Richard III at Bosworth by Henry Tudor the lands and castle at Middleham became part of the Crown."
Château de Fougères,Michael Whitmarsh,5,A great example of a Medieval Castle. You can explorer the towers and ramparts. There are also some limited period displays. A bargin at €9 per adults. I would recommend.
Château de Fougères,Jarrod Hunt,5,"Amazing, amazing, amazing castle. One of the best we've ever been to anywhere. The audio guide is great, though it was a bit glitchy from time to time. Lots of intact buildings, so much to explore, and it's a lovely little village surrounding, very much worthwhile wandering around afterwards up to the public gardens near the church. Highly recommend!"
Château de Fougères,RBR Inc,5,"Amazing! Over 1,000 years of history. A village within a castle. So much of it in ruins, but restoration well underway."
Château de Fougères,Pranav Bapat,4,"Picturesque place, good location, between Mont Saint michel and Versaille. Entry is not that expensive either, if you're a student or under 26.  A lot of options to eat and drink.  A must visit if you like forts, and a relaxing trip."
Château de Fougères,SnapCrackleNPop,5,"Awesome place to walk around and see, places to get refreshments and lunch and souvenirs."
Castillo de Peracense,john sutcliffe,5,"Fantastic place. Rode out on our motorbikes from zaragoza. Beautiful, historic plage recommend seeing If you're a fan of history."
Castillo de Peracense,Georgette,5,"If you love weird nature landscapes, this is the place to go. This military medieval castle with it's defense weapon display is atop a huge rock overlooking below and all around... Mesmerizing"
Castillo de Peracense,Jasper Hermsen,5,Great castle and amazing place to visit.
Castillo de Peracense,Gonzalo J. Sanfiz,3,"The landscape and location of the castle are breathtaking. However, since the castle has been fully restored lately, it looks more like an amusement park attraction rather than an historical site... more focus into the original condition of the construction and the history of the site would have been more appreciated"
Castillo de Peracense,Caspar Dechmann,1,Wrong opening times: during the winter The castle is closed on Fridays. Argh.
Belvedere del Greco,Antonio Indigeno,5,Superb viewpoint on the climb that leads to the Castle of Scilla. The view is on the magnificent beach of Scilla.
Belvedere del Greco,Roberto Castellani,4,"At night and in winter, the view of the beach and the promenade, with the sound of the waves as the only background, is extremely fascinating for a tourist."
Fortress Hohensalzburg,T Jones,5,"Great museum and fortress. I walked up the hill instead of taking the funicular, which was a pretty steep long hike. There are a few museums which were very well set up and cover various parts of the history of Salzburg. The views throughout the entire fortress are incredible. This is a must see when visiting Salzburg."
Fortress Hohensalzburg,Andrew Streams,5,"The funicular is a fun way to get to the fortress. Why walk? Amazing 360 degree picture postcard views. Some interesting exhibits and the panorama tour is well worth it. You’ll need at least 2 hours here, more if you have lunch. Was nice to learn some of the history about Salzburg"
Fortress Hohensalzburg,patheesen,5,"A castle that is more of a walled mountain village, I loved the variety of things to do. You can climb the tower, visit a church or multiple museums. The panoramic part is great as the views are beautiful. We bought a basic ticket which was more then enough entertainment."
Fortress Hohensalzburg,George Sorrells,5,"Spent our last few hours in Salzburg hiking up to the Fortress.  It was a great way to spend the morning.  I really enjoyed learning about the centuries of change the fortress went through.  I would recommend walking up, so you get a really good idea of why the fortress was so strong.  The hill is long and steep.  Seeing the three different gates makes a big impression as to the strength of the place."
Fortress Hohensalzburg,Wajdy Shalghin,5,"A place full of history. A castle that was never conquered. Several stages of time and many stages of tools and weapons. The view is amazing and it is very organized. You need plenty of time to see everything and it deserves. I really enjoyed and visited everything, however I haven’t read everything as this will make you spend a full day there. It is a must see place in Salzburg."
Mingary Castle,Tracy Long,5,"I love this castle! My husband and I went to Mingary castle to celebrate our 25 year wedding anniversary and it was perfect! The castle retains all the magic of its incredible history while housing beautifully designed guest rooms, lounge and restaurant. Our room was perfect down to last detail -  the carefully selected furnishings for the bedroom and bath, and also the gorgeous textiles on the bed and curtains were all a wonderful part of the experience. The food was exquisite - delicious, original, and clearly made with love and real passion for the culinary arts! The wine pairings were perfect with every dish. The surrounding nature is breathtaking - the walking and short drives to local sites are not to be missed (unless, of course, you are just too comfortable in your lovely room to leave the castle!) Thank you so much to our very talented and kind hosts! You made us feel welcomed and helped us make our anniversary celebration a truly memorable and special occasion!"
Mingary Castle,Margaret Hanson,5,"My husband and I eloped here and it was everything we’d hoped for. The castle and its setting are stunning, the rooms were beautiful, comfortable, and spacious, the food was absolutely amazing (Colin is going to put this place on the map as a culinary destination in its own right), and the service was impeccable. Many thanks to Jess and Colin and all their staff who helped make our day perfect and provided extra help. The drive there involves single track roads, which wasn’t always fun, but it was 100% worth it."
Mingary Castle,Carole Howe,5,"Had a delicious meal at Mingary Castle, the 5 course taster menu was well presented every course very tasty. The star of show had to be the Saddle of Roe Buck, an outstanding dish indeed. And all served up in a totally unique place. What a beautiful place Mingary Castle is. The views from the castle walls is stunning and the transformation from ruined walls to this hotel and restaurant  is so well done. Well worth a visit"
Mingary Castle,Penny Horner,5,We had the 5 course dinner last night. Fabulous food with amazing eye for detail. I wish I knew how Colin makes each item on the plate so flavoursome. I don't eat meat or dairy and I'm  grateful for the effort put in to provide me with a fabulous individual menu.
Mingary Castle,Joshua Jones,5,"This place is amazing! Our dining experience was exceptional, the staff’s attention to detail was outstanding. Honestly, I can’t stress how attentive they were and what a wonderful experience it was. The food was also outstanding,  some of the best food I’ve ever had. The chef is an artist! Our room was incredibly romantic with the most amazing views and we stayed in a castle. I absolutely love Scotland and will return to stay at Mingary Castle. This castle is beautiful, the food excellent, but the service is what really made this experience one of the best I’ve had here in Scotland or anywhere!"
Amberley Castle,Paul Fairlight,5,"We had our wedding here on the 17th of August. The whole experience was absolutely outstanding! For us this will be our benchmark for service and room quality. The food was some of the most beautiful and delicious ever. The staff remained efficient, professional friendly throughout even though they could do with more. The room was very quiet, bathroom and bed were divine. We will definitely be returning."
Amberley Castle,Jazz M,5,"One of my favorites for the last 30 years. The castle is amazing, the grounds well kept. We normally have dinner here when we stay, but this time just breakfast (always excellent). There is a cute little village within walking distance. There's also a nice hike with views of Amberley and Arundel that starts from the castle grounds."
Amberley Castle,Mel Mann,5,"We had afternoon tea at Amberley Castle this afternoon with family. The weather was perfect, the service amazing, very friendly and professional. The afternoon tea was out of this world, wonderful savoury selection of toasted sandwich, assorted sandwiches, wraps, pigs in blankets mini croissants to name a few of the items. Amazing sweet selection of scones and cream and assorted mini cakes. The teas were very nice we had the elderflower and lemon and ginger. Very relaxed atmosphere, no rush to finish and go. Had a walk around the beautiful grounds, which are immaculate. Beautiful building with so much history and character. All in all a wonderful afternoon, a big thank you to all concerned. We will be back.🙂"
Amberley Castle,Michael King,5,"Came for dinner really nice location, staff our trained to a high level everyone was kind, polite and respectful friendly.  Food was very good but wasn't outstanding as the service except for the pastry chef. The tarte tatin and after dinner the chocolate's were beyond words the flavours were so on point."
Amberley Castle,Adrian Monaco,5,"My wife and I had an unforgettable birthday trip to Amberley in early July. I would absolutely recommend this hotel (castle?) to anyone looking for a perfect countryside escape. We could not get over how idyllic the grounds were, how friendly and personalized the service was, and the overall hospitality from everyone that greeted us, especially all the small touches (everyone knowing our name and dietary requirements, cookies in the room, a signed letter upon arrival). It went far above and beyond our expectations. Just look at the pictures; you won’t regret booking this!"
Barcaldine Castle,Amanda,5,Absolutely amazing experience. The castle is well decorated with many mysteries lurking around each corner including a bottle neck dungeon! Cozy castle by the Loch. Breakfast was excellent. Comfortable and friendly environment.
Barcaldine Castle,Alvar Chambers,5,"My wife wanted to stay in a castle on our trip to Scotland and this really fitted the bill.  Small picturesque original castle with great views converted into an up market B&B.  A lot of work has been done on the interior to give it an authentic feel and bring out the history of the place.  A lot of thought has been put into the rooms’ decor (slightly gloomy dark castle vibe in some rooms with portraits staring down on you).  Comfy beds, some four poster beds.  Traditional but functional bathroom fittings.  Mod cons are not neglected, eg in some rooms the framed mirrors convert at the touch of a remote control into smart TVs where you can log in to your own streaming accounts.  Excellent breakfasts with a good choice of hot options served in the atmospheric Great Hall, which is also a great place to relax in the evenings with a fireplace you can light (no bar currently but you can bring your own drinks and glasses are provided).    There is no dinner offered but plenty of suggestions of good local restaurants."
Barcaldine Castle,Sheri Lucas,5,"Barcaldine was remarkable!  My husband and I visit Scotland often and for this trip decided to plan a surprise stay for our friends and family that were traveling with us.  We have stayed at several Castles and Castle Hotels on past trips, but Barcaldine Castle outshined the lot.  While it is more intimate than many of the larger castle hotels, it was exceedingly comfortable and seemed to be a bit truer to its original character.  The Great Hall was where we had breakfast and our special anniversary party, complete with roaring fire in a grand fireplace surrounded by plenty of comfortable seating.  The manager, Veronica, was our own piece of Scottish magic.   She helped keep the surprise and did a fantastic job acting as if she was ""giving a tour"" to our group before finally handing my sister an invitation to her own anniversary party (to everyone's complete shock!).  She was so helpful over the months of planning and even left a bottle of champagne in my sister's room, among other nice things!   While we were there, she made herself available (even on her birthday!) to make sure everything was perfect, which it was.  She and her team also worked with us to make sure they had the dishes and flatware needed for the special anniversary dinner.   Everything worked like clockwork.  The sign of a brilliant team!  I can actually review all 6 rooms since we had friends or family in each of them.  All of our travel companions reported comfortable beds, really nice showers, beautiful views, and wonderful hospitality trays.  Each luxurious room was tastefully decorated and true enough to character without losing comfort and modern touches (the gold framed mirror that is really a TV, intricately carved 4 posters in some rooms but with comfortable mattresses and bedding just as examples of the incredible balance). Some of the rooms had turrets with a vanity/desk in.  All were perfect for our group.  The breakfast each morning was delicious as well.  I think between the 10 of us we had at least one of everything on the morning menu and it was all beautiful, from the Full Scottish (both regular and vegetarian) to the Porridge with Fruit.  Breakfast was always perfectly cooked across the board and very well portioned to last until lunch or later.  The entire castle was charming and incredibly clean.  I hope if you have a special event upcoming that you contact Veronica and crew.  You will not regret it!  Magical!"
Barcaldine Castle,Beth Brockwell,5,"Barcaldine Castle is amazing! As is the owner, Veronica, who is hands-on with guests.  We stayed in the Breadalbane suite.  It has a super comfy carved super-king bed with nice linens. It has a luxurious bathroom with a clawfoot tub. It was a magical experience thanks to Veronica and team!  I am going to save my pennies and go back ... soon, I hope."
Barcaldine Castle,Spirit of Selkie,5,Probably one of the most beautiful small original castles in Scotland. It's privately owned and runs as a 6 room b&b and exclusive use micro wedding venue. Run by Veronica & her staff...this is a must stop and must stay for any Campbell Clan fans !
Tioram Castle,Tunde Cockshott,5,"Just visit. It is in a stunning location, drive to carpark is down single track road past stunning wee secluded loch with fairytale arched bridge. Then you see this amazing castle. Walk along shore across causeway to get great views. Cannot enter ruins but still worth it for the location"
Tioram Castle,Ben Young,5,"A castle like from a fairytale! Situated on a tidal island but easily accessible, it’s a lovely spot for a picnic! There’s some great walking nearby too."
Tioram Castle,emsky,5,"Was passing through and wish we could have stayed longer, beautiful and historical place. Such a shame (like so many others) that it's been left to crumble. These types of places deserve preservation."
Tioram Castle,Paul Štutas,5,"Beautiful castle ruins, only accessible during a low tide. Went for a swim, saw an eagle, herons, crabs. Quiet place with few visitors."
Tioram Castle,Carol Evans,5,Such a pretty little spot with a short walk from the car park. Single track road with passing places makes it a little tricky to get to but worth it. Good sized car park.
Durham Castle,it get,5,"The castle is worth to visit, but noted that not all rooms are available for public visitors, because this castle is used as student accommodation, so only guided tour provided. There are 6 zones to visit, including the entry gate, several chapels and the great hall. The student guide was really friendly and patient, shared many knowledge about the history of castle. Strongly recommend to visit when the weather is good."
Durham Castle,Liz B,4,"I wasn’t expecting the castle to be owned/managed by the University and couldn’t understand why all the websites linked back to the university but that explains it!  I had a guided tour by Katy who was very knowledgeable and easy to talk to.  She explained the rooms, the university use of the halls etc very well.  The castle was unlike most castles I’ve visited previously.  Less about armour and keeping villagers safe, more about the reformation and uni students.  What a gorgeous place to have as your halls!  Definitely book tickets days in advance.  I only had the choice of one tour (at 16.15) on the day of my booking.  About 25 people per tour."
Durham Castle,kinjal gangar,5,We had booked a guided tour of the castle which lasts around an hour. You get enough time to explore the castle and take pictures. I found it fascinating that the castle is also a student accommodation. The tour guide was very friendly and had good knowledge about the castle. The guided tour costs £5 (you can ask for student discount).
Durham Castle,Andrew Bickle,1,Read website before going. Website mentions self guided tours in summer months. When we arrived it was guided tours only which were all sold out!! Please adjust the website or make things clearer!!
Durham Castle,Peter Malone,5,I love Durham I spend more time at Durham then at home now I have been in the castle i am thinking of having bed a breakfast there when I have the more just to say I have had sleep in a castle i don't have the money right now the people where lovely and I really enjoyed visiting the castle.
Beeston Castle,Taylor Nield,4,I got there close to the closing time so I only spent 1/2 an hour to an hour there. But the view at the top was breathtaking. You could see for miles! The only bad thing was the amount of flies in some areas when walking up to the top of the castle. There were lots of squirrels in the trees and two crows that seemed to be dancing together in the sky (they definitely weren’t fighting) which was a nice touch to the historical scene.
Beeston Castle,Emily Tricarico-Humber,5,"Great castle. Just be mindful that the walk up is very steep. The stone age house was amazing and is worth a visit just in its self. The volunteer in the stone house was lovely and so welcoming, was just a shame regarding the staff in the shop/entrance (one woman in particular was miserable and come across rude). We spent a good couple of hours here. Car park is free for members or £3 for non members. Once at the top of the castle you can see most of Chester! Will happily return in the future."
Beeston Castle,Steven Moseley,5,"Fantastic place to spend a few hours. Not much of the castle left now, but the views are breathtaking. Also, a roundhouse to visit and some caves at the bottom of the hill. Walk up the hill is a  little challenging take good footwear.  The site is run by English Heritage, who do a good job of preserving what's left. Would like to see a few information boards at the top in the castle 🏰.  There is a little gift shop / museum and a big car park , chargeable for  o members."
Beeston Castle,Andrew Thomas,5,"Ruined castle on a hilltop with fantastic views and hidden attractions. From the entrance building, it's an uphill walk to the castle, crossing over a dramatic bridge at the top. It's well worth the effort, as you're rewarded with a 360 degree panoramic vista. On a clear day it's possible to see 8 counties, looking west to the mountains of North Wales, and east to the Peak District. In the inner bailey, look out for the well, which is one of the deepest in any English castle at over 300 feet deep. There's more to look at in the lower grounds, including a recreated Bronze Age roundhouse, and sandstone caves (closed off, but you can still get a glimpse inside through the railings). Facilities include a parking area with a café across the road from the castle, and a gift shop and toilets on site. The castle and grounds are dog friendly. The parking area was getting full by early afternoon in peak season, so it's worth arriving early to beat the crowds. Opening times are 10:00 - 17:00, adult tickets are £10 and child tickets £5.90."
Beeston Castle,Anthony Chan,5,Quite far away from public transport and had to cycle from crewe but it is a very big area. The main castle ruins are on top of a hill which takes around 10 minutes to go up. There’s information boards around the site. The staff are nice and allowed me to park the my bike within the grounds. There’s a small cafe and a lot of benches and tables for picnic and eat your own food. Great experience but hope there will be more options for public transport to this site.
Malahide Castle & Gardens,george,5,Beautiful castle set in an stunning location.  The castle is really well preserved and offers visitors a unique perspective on Irish history and influence of the Vikings and Normans.  The gardens are also well worth visiting and is also home to the butterfly house.  There are is a cafe and a small shop. The castle is very dog friendly.
Malahide Castle & Gardens,Francesco “Fra” N,5,"Great outdoor place, nice guided tour  inside the castle with guide and staff absolutely lovely, and helped us to get the best ticket deal for 6 people. Our guide in particular was very good, friendly, professional and entertaining! With the tour ticket you get the entrance to the fairy trail and some gardens for a nice relaxing walk."
Malahide Castle & Gardens,Ann Wood,5,"We had a tour of the castle which was so interesting to see. Our guide Bláithín was so friendly and informative. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and the fairy trail was great fun for children (and the adults) to explore all the different areas. There is a fantastic Avoca shop with a huge range of food, gifts and souvenirs to choose from. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon at the castle and gardens. A pleasant walk to the train station was a bonus as it took us straight back to Connolly station in Dublin city centre."
Malahide Castle & Gardens,Dave Renz Beltrano,5,Great park to walk around with the family. Walkways are mostly paved and can be accesible for our fellow wheelbounded people. There are also parts of the park that needs an entrance fee like this fairy park that has different segments to enjoy and take pictures.
Malahide Castle & Gardens,Stu Robson,5,"Lovely area. Lots of space to walk and play areas for kids. We went to see some live music here in the grounds so we didn't get to experience too much of the gardens, but what we saw was lovely! The music was set up as a festival style with the stage and grounds all fenced off but what a setting!"
Blenheim Palace,Peter Depledge,5,"A wonderful historical palace and gardens built and enriched over time by the twelve Dukes of Marlborough. The house contains many sumptuously furnished and decorated rooms, and the public areas are set out to tell the stories of the various Dukes and their immediate families, friends, and relatives and to exhibit the treasures they collected over 300 years. You can explore the house at your own pace and, if you wish, you could easily spend many hours following the audio guide that is available. The state rooms and library are spectacular. Knowledgeable guides are on hand if you have any questions.  The first Duke was John Churchill and the Churchill family (now Spencer-Churchill) still use Blenheim Palace as their home. A special exhibition covering the life of Winston Churchill, who was born at Blenheim, gives a great insight into the daily and personal life of the wartime leader and his marriage to Clementine.  The Palace has extensive gardens both formal and informal. The garden landscape was enhanced under the guidance of Capability Brown and the large lake, which is a major feature of the current garden, was his conception. The gardens alone take several hours to visit and require a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended.  There are several places to eat and drink and the food is very good.  Highly recommended."
Blenheim Palace,ken timson,5,Absolutely full of excellence and history   We made paid for the day and you get a free upgrade to a year pass. You are allowed to go into the house and the food is excellent in the restaurant. You can just walk around the gardens if you want. There is always someone to answer your questions. Try it out. Winston Churchill's birth place. Excellence is all around.
Blenheim Palace,The Hungry Foodie,5,"Visiting Blenheim Palace was a great experience despite the rain. The palace itself is a masterpiece of ornate and historical architecture, with its grand interior and stunning gardens and lakes that surround it.  One of the highlights of my visit was the dining room, which took my breath away. The opulent decor and attention to detail created a truly enchanting atmosphere. It was a delight to enjoy a meal in such a magnificent setting. Parking at Blenheim Palace was convenient, as there were ample parking spaces available on site. This made it easy to access the palace and explore its grounds without any hassle.  I also had the chance to visit the gift shop, which offered a range of upmarket items at good prices. It was a pleasure to browse through the selection and find unique souvenirs to take home.  Overall, my experience at Blenheim Palace was truly memorable. From the breathtaking interior and lovely gardens to the convenience of parking and the delightful dining options, it was a visit that exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend a visit to Blenheim Palace for anyone looking to immerse themselves in history, beauty, and a truly unforgettable experience."
Blenheim Palace,STUART TURNER,5,"A huge day out can be had here. So much to see and do especially if you like walking the grounds. Stunning views, excellent gardens, great exhibition on Churchill, and great fun for the family in the maze."
Blenheim Palace,Jordan Dimov,5,"Always great to visit. Very extensive, beautiful grounds, good for long walks. Make sure to pay a visit to the walled garden as well, which is a bit out of the way (you can take the mini train!) The butterfly house is breathtaking. And the labyrinth is well worth getting lost in.  As you can tell, great for children."
Enniskillen Castle Museums,Antonio Pedraza Herrera,4,"Lovely museum, interactive activities and rich in history. Not too bad price for a family pass."
Enniskillen Castle Museums,Ken Brady,5,Really good material and well presented. Well worth a visit.
Enniskillen Castle Museums,smithdigitalvideo,5,"I didn't pay to go to the indoor part of the museum. I only went to the free outdoor part. Several sections that seemed to be housed in former stables. One section noted the use of jeeps during a war. Jeeps were invented in my home town of Butler, Pennsylvania."
Enniskillen Castle Museums,Mick Brods,5,Thoroughly enjoyed a very professional presented history of the past. Some diverse subjects to make it very interesting.
Enniskillen Castle Museums,Tom Carty,5,Interesting: not enough on the Maguires imho. Helpful staff.
Ballindalloch Castle and Gardens,Steven Noble,2,"What can I say not much.Was looking forward to going but it was just so disappointing while entering the castle were told no photos wasn't allowed photos are apart of peoples memories going through the castle .It just didn't have the feeling that you would normally get from a castle and I don't know why its called a castle its more like a big country house. Gardens were well maintained, the food in the cafe was excellent, gift shop was well over priced but most places like this is.Staff in the cafe where lovely."
Ballindalloch Castle and Gardens,Vicky,5,"Amazing castle and grounds as well as the tea room.  Could easily have spent all day here looking round the castle and the grounds.  Came here with a bus trip that just had access to the grounds, paid the extra to go in the castle, which is well worth the money.  So full of history, both the grounds and the castle are very well looked after and maintained.  The cakes in the tea are  delicious they are so moist.  The staff are soo friendly, helpful and knowledge"
Ballindalloch Castle and Gardens,Alexander Steinhorst,5,"A very beautiful and serene place. The vibrant gardens are a joy to explore. Not a whole lot of visitors and much quieter than the usual tourist locations such as Balmoral Castle. We spent about 2 hours, not including the castle or cafe."
Ballindalloch Castle and Gardens,Remeus,5,"Lovely area, the castle beautiful and I personally like the Lego treasure hunt to keep kids busy. I thought the labyrinth would have walls, but it's a grass one (I misread the map). The gardens are stunning at this time of year, I would strongly recommend visiting this castle."
Ballindalloch Castle and Gardens,Zoltan Gergi,5,Lovely castle with a huge beautiful garden (loved the ground with the roses) and a cosy tearoom (the cakes are amazing). We had a nice walk on the river bank (River Spey/Avon). We were lucky enough to have a chat with the previous owners. Highly recommended!
Castle Sinclair Girnigoe,Wenyi Lee Stones,5,Took a walk around and inside the castle and was amazed by the magnificent view of the coastline. There are many information boards introducing the history of the castle. We love the serenity the castle provides and it’s definitely a place worth visiting.
Castle Sinclair Girnigoe,James Goodliffe,5,"Wow, really enjoyed it here. There is a carpark nearby. The views are amazing and very atmospheric walking around the ruins. When we visited, one side was windy whilst the other was nicely sheltered. Lots of seabirds on the cliff faces.  The informative notice boards were really helpful."
Castle Sinclair Girnigoe,Ewald S,5,A short walk from the car park and you are truly inside a Time Machine. Reading about the history and walking around the ruins of this castle was an unforgettable experience. The waters and rocks surrounding it was absolutely beautiful as well.
Castle Sinclair Girnigoe,estela z,5,"It's a really stunning 14th century castle located on a cliff, although only less than 1/3 of the castle remained, you can still see the structure, with the help of the information board."
Castle Sinclair Girnigoe,Ruth O'Connell,4,"Just plain impressive really! Good for a short visit, quite a lot of scaffolding, hope they can restore it more fully. It's free to visit."
"Raby Castle, Deer Park & The Plotters' Forest",Roy Blyth,5,"Wonderful place to visit. The new Plotters Lodge is a must for the kids. It's a magical woodland adventure for all the family. The castle and grounds are immaculate. Food and drinks are a little on the expensive side, but it's well worth it to round off a great day out, because you will definitely work up an appetite walking around the 200 acres of woodland and deer park."
"Raby Castle, Deer Park & The Plotters' Forest",David Layton,5,"Lovely place for all ages. The guided tour around the interior of the castle was very interesting, even for someone like me who does not normally bother. Great grounds to walk around and large ponds full of wildlife. Good selection of food/drink/ice cream."
"Raby Castle, Deer Park & The Plotters' Forest",Richard Lemm,4,"Very clean place. Worth the admission prices. Knowledgeable friendly staff. Food prices are reasonable. Could do with clearer signage around the castle & grounds.  Slow paced and leisurely. Plenty of easy parking and worth a return visit. A nice place if visiting on your own, as a family or group."
"Raby Castle, Deer Park & The Plotters' Forest",Matt T,4,"Recommended by a friend, Raby Castle is a fantastic day out for all age groups and we will definitely be going back. We went to:  1. Plotters Forest. This is a massive outdoor wooden play area built into the forest which the kids loved and got lost in for a few hours. There is a cafe, toilets and plenty of places to sit while the kids play. It was £30 for a family but note you only get a two hour slot, but we were allowed to stay longer.  2. Castle and Deer Park. £6 per adult and kids go free. The park was nice enough, but what was most impressive was the Castle; the rooms have been so well preserved and full of social history. The volunteers were attentive and engaging with the kids, telling them stories and history about the castle and artefacts on show.  The only reason Raby Castle didn’t get five stars is that I thought the cafe was a tad more expensive than competitors and they were extremely stingy with the ice cream - it was £2.50 for what I would classify as half a normal scoop for a child."
"Raby Castle, Deer Park & The Plotters' Forest",David Comeau,5,"This is an excellent castle full of history, artwork and great staff.  The proctors in each room are willing to talk and answer questions.   The paintings and furniture are fantastic.   The cafe staff are lovely and the deserts pleased everyone!    Thank you so much for taking us on a trip through history."
Slains Castle,Amber Helms,5,About a mile walk (in one direction) down a long gravel drive but the views are breathtaking and well worth it. It would be a great place to take a picnic just to sit and enjoy the coastline. The castle is in ruins so mind your step and wear good walking shoes. It’s best to go early like I did (before noon); the longer I was there more people started to show up. It’s a very safe place to park the car but spots are limited. It’s very peaceful to sit and watch the seagulls and the water hitting the rocks. Note: it is on a cliff edge so mind your steps if you walk down towards the coast. Parking and the castle visit is free.
Slains Castle,Fabrizio Oddo,5,"Amazing views! It's worth a trip, the car park is not far away from the castle and it's free. The ruins offer opportunity for nice photos and there are few paths along the coastline. Be careful, don't go too near the cliffs."
Slains Castle,Liane Vaz,5,"Probably one of my favorite castle ruins that I've visited. Short walk from the parking area. No crowds. Free. Beautiful views. Multiple architecture styles. No cordoned off areas. Would definitely recommend and would go back if I ever find myself in the area again (unlikely but nice to dream). Check out the underground crypt (if you dare), the spiral staircase, and the old bridge to the castle."
Slains Castle,Stephen wb,5,Lovely ruin to visit and explore carefully. A short accessable walk from the village. Commanding views of the coastline.  Don't follow the Google maps route to walk there. Head to Cruden car park and follow the path from there. It's all flat going that way round and shorter than the way suggested on Google.
Slains Castle,Cy Marven,5,"Great place to explore. And free. A rich history including Bram Stoker's Dracula and Winston Churchill, not together. Well once, for an interview, but that's a different story. Great sea views too, I saw a big sea mammal with a fin 😄."
Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden,maria coleman,5,"I love this castle, have visited numerous times over the years. The history of this castle is fascinating, from a Norman tower through to the Elizabeth era. As I am obsessed with the medieval and Tudor period, I love coming here. There are minimal info boards, however they do give a little information. You are better off buying the guide book. The castle is a ruin, but still beautiful to look at and explore. Steps and walkways have been installed in places, this makes a big difference when looking around. Garden is stunning. Great for taking a picnic too. It is English Heritage, so if you are a member it’s free entry. There is an on site car park again free for EH members. Toilets, cafe and shop on site. Staff very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend a visit."
Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden,Simon (Simps),5,Excellent day out for my birthday. Quite a lot more to see than I believed from reading the reviews. We were there 4 hours and walked about 4 miles which surprised us. We bought a guide book from where you book in and it's full of extra information so well worth the money. It also tells you that if you take your parking tickets back after you visit you can get the parking fee back which we did. Although £6 for all day parking isn't too bad anyway. Will definitely go back. Thanks
Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden,Richie Levi F A Miller Mullen (Levi),5,"Loved this site, enjoyed it more than Stonehenge. Arrived early, just after 10am. Best time is usually early, it was starting to get busier by time we left around 11.30.  The car park is just at the end of the path to the grounds, 1 minute walk, free for EH members too. You pass the shop first - even if you pre-booked tickets you need to go check in at the shop (there wasn’t a sign for that so we didn’t, and found out further along we needed to go back to check in). Takes a minute, super quick. Then you reach the site entrance where an EH staff member gives you a map and tells you a couple of highlights about the site - nice, very helpful, smiling and not pushy. We didn’t opt for the audio tour. Then you’re free to roam about. There’s so much history at this site and the ruins are amazing - incredibly big with great intact parts, key features still preserved and explained, lots of signage to explain what you’re looking at etc. In one area, by the Elizabethan bed chamber, there was another staff member who was really nice and directed us through without being forceful or trying to interact too much. Your imagine runs wild thinking what this place would have been like in full swing back when it was at its prime with its stone spiral staircases, the gardens, the big fireplaces and huge windows; this place felt magical and almost unreal. If you’re into history, architecture, fantasy or old-fashioned romance you’ll love this site. We didn’t try the cafe but it looked pretty nice, but as we arrived before the site opened we got breakfast locally - there is a great little cafe around the corner called Morning Sunshine which does amazing food and is really well priced. The shop was a little small, but probably the right size for the site, the product was reasonably priced and an interesting array, though we did not buy anything. All in all a really nice site and will probably visit again."
Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden,Anthony Chan,5,Beautiful gardens and ruins. There’s a nice cafe and gallery which showcase the history of the place. Some interesting multimedia in the museum including a minecraft game. Most interesting fact was that there used to be man made lake here for defense but was drained after the civil war
Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden,Monica Calanche,5,"Great day out by myself the space was beautifully kept and the gardens smelt amazing, not busy at all. Lovely exhibitions and the audio guide was immersive worth getting one. Plenty of space do recommend as a day out even having a picnic. The tea room and bookshop were spectacular. Free entry with English heritage membership which you can get on site"
National Trust - Castle Ward,Patricia Maginnis,5,"Brilliant place for the kids. My two (8 and 5) had an absolute ball. There was so much for them to do, lots of different activities that they really enjoyed from the play barn to the straw maze with games and archery, to the park area, and the craft activites. They loved seeing inside the house too. Great facilities, lovely coffee. Absolutely worthwhile family trip"
National Trust - Castle Ward,Amy Cronin,5,"Great spot to stretch the legs, get some fresh air and exercise as well as Take in some history and have a laugh. Play area for the kids, the den building was fun. I would assume there are days with events or activities on but its a grand day out to burn off some energy. Enjoy."
National Trust - Castle Ward,James Cummings,5,Great place in a beautiful setting. Need Google maps to get you there. Some great views of Strangford Loch and walks as well. There is a house there and tours are included in your ticket price. Guides very knowledgeable and the house itself has two distinct eras inside. Good car parking and a cafe and National Trust shop. If you are not a member it is about £12 per adult. Well worth a visit.
National Trust - Castle Ward,David Gardner,4,The grounds are awesome and it's a very cool site. Unfortunately the Winterfell in the TV show was heavily CGI and the actual grounds look nothing like it apart from the tower. However it was still a beautiful location and I'm happy to have stopped off here.
National Trust - Castle Ward,A Jain,5,"Great spot for a family day out. Green landscapes, a peaceful trail and a scenic lake view. The main castle is well maintained. Approachable by public transport from Belfast."
Highclere Castle,Judy Bird,5,"Beautiful gardens, especially the wild flower meadow. Very interesting house and Egyptian exhibition. House includes pictures of the filming of Downton Abbey in the actual positions in the rooms where they took place. Good catering facilities with lots of inside & outside seating areas. Well worth a visit."
Highclere Castle,Sue Lewis,5,"Visiting the castle is very well organised and a pleasure to be able to amble throughout at your own pace. Well informed, friendly guides help us really understand the fascinating history of both the castle and the family. The splendid grounds and wonderful, colourful gardens made this a really grand day out ! Well worth a visit. No photography allowed inside the house."
Highclere Castle,Frances Fagg,5,"A beautiful castle and Home Stunning grounds too. The guides were very interesting and informative and particularly helpful with disabled clients, I was unable to negotiate stairs and they gave me a chair and photo book of upstairs whilst I waited for my relatives. Also showed me an easier way to see the Egyptian exhibition."
Highclere Castle,Erika A,5,"We are HUGE Downton Abby fans (Americans) and could not wait to come here. We rented a car from Heathrow Airport and took advantage of the free parking on the grounds.  We arrived about an hour earlier which was perfect to explore the gardens, and take lots of pictures. All the staff on the property were so knowledgeable and friendly. They offer a couple of snack/food options, and have nice seating areas outdoors. The gift shop was so cute, and we had to get a bunch of Highclere  souvenirs.  We lined up 10 minutes before our start time and we allowed to enter in small groups. You are never rushed from a room and could take your time marveling at everything and ask questions. They have pictures from the show in some rooms so you can compare the layouts.  We loved it here and would love to come back for a special event in the future!  Also want to mention that It doesn’t feel like museum but an actual home which is rare, because we went to Buckingham Palace and you can tell people don’t actually live in those rooms.  HIGHLY recommend!!"
Highclere Castle,Paul Crowhurst,5,"Easy to get to from the A34. Plenty of parking. The house was very nice, lots to look at and read. Staff on hand if you had questions. Nice to see that it was quite obviously lived in. It was a sunny day so some good photo opportunities. The grounds and surounding estate were fabulous, I don't envy the gardener! Well worth a visit even if you're not a Downton fan. Watch out for wasps when you're having your cream tea!"
Upnor Castle,Richard Adlem (Rich),4,"It's a small fort that you will need around 2.5 hrs to visit, really well maintained and not too crowded when we visited on an August Sunday afternoon. Remember it's an old castle fort with lots of steps, accessibility wasn't a thing when it was built so it's not really advisable for people with mobility issues. Kids really loved running up and down the steps though, it has maintained its authenticity and really feels like stepping back in time. There is a small shop which sells ice-cream and gifts, a little self service coffee area but no cafe. There are picnic benches though so perfect to bring a picnic, or make use of one of the 2 historic pubs which are right on the doorstep."
Upnor Castle,Peter Nicholson,4,Lovely little gem hidden away. The approach down a beautiful cobbled street leading to the entrance adds to its appeal with great views over the Medway. Not a great deal to see however and could do with some more info boards or signage to add to the history. No cafe onside so bring a picnic!
Upnor Castle,Cedric Hurth,4,Smaller castle with a very interesting unique architecture that leaves you to meander around the various towers. The use as a gunpowder storage facility is well documented and nicely reconstructed. Beautiful river views as well.
Upnor Castle,cristi cristian,5,"Upnor Castle is part of the English Heritage, so members can visit it for free. It was built in 1559 on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I as a fort gun to defend her warships at Medway. The castle failed to meet its purpose when the Dutch fleet attached the dockyard in 1667. In itself, after hundreds of years, the castle looks impeccable and very sturdy. It suffered improvements over the years, and because the erosion processes were stopped, the castle will endure over time. It is a great venue for weddings and special occasions and provides amazing scenery for visitors. The view over the marina and the River Medway is spectacular and dreamy. As you enter the castle, the 'warden' will great you with his lavish movements and welcoming purr. No one knows his name but goes by many according to the legend. You can buy different objects that are replicas of long-time original artefacts. The staff are friendly and very welcoming. Toilets are available and quite clean and well maintained."
Upnor Castle,JoeTheBassMan61,4,Interesting castle worth a couple of hours exploring! Lovely location with nice views. Half of the castle rooms were empty maybe lacking some more displays / mannequins to really bring it to life. Staff very welcoming and pleasant!
Elizabeth Castle,Carrie-Ann Lee,5,Amazing place. Staff were knowledgeable and polite. The guy doing the parade was amazing and keeps you engaged at all times. Definitely worth the visit We walked over and then went on the amphibious vehicle back. Both brilliant too
Elizabeth Castle,Chris Courtney,5,Great trip to this beautiful castle with such a mixed history. Make sure to get there for midday display from very charismatic guide who remains in character throughout musket and Canon display. Chance to get involved. Much bigger than it looks and quite a fair bit of walking to get around it all. Amphibious bus leaves every 10mins but limited spaces so plan in advance if you want to catch displays.
Elizabeth Castle,Carol Cramer,4,"Lovely walk on a nice day over to the castle at low tide and we came back on the amphibious truck which was fun. Castle was great to have a walk around and there are some lovely views of the island.  Several events held during the day with staff playing roles of various sailors and guards which was interesting - the cannon firing certainly makes you jump! Lots of walking and steps, but coffee shop with lovely garden for a break. Well worth a visit."
Elizabeth Castle,Paul Wennington,5,"A great experience to go to. The interactive demonstrations are informative, thought provoking  and entertaining. Currently building work is being undertaken in upgrading some buildings but it did not stop us from enjoying our visit."
Elizabeth Castle,Lynda Edwarda,5,A great experience.  Try to arrange your visit to include a tour of the castle as it is very informative.  Lovely views and such fun to get there. We'll worth a visit.
Glamis Castle,A I,5,"Glamis is the childhood home of the late Queen Elizabeth’s mother. The interiors are filled with family portraits and photographs from the late queen's childhood. Her family's recorded history extends back 1,000 years and is described in a series of panels near the entrance and by the helpful tour guides. The cafeteria can be busy with bus tours but the woodland walks and walled garden are far enough away to be relaxingly quiet. Woodcarvings of Shakespeare’s witches and others are found along the woodland walk. Shop, toilets and car parking are close to the castle. Well worth a visit."
Glamis Castle,Andy Taylor,5,Absolutely loved this castle and the tour conducted by Euan who was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. Shame you cannot take photos as its difficult to remember and take in everything you've seen. I actually preferred this castle to Scone Palace. Nice to see recognition of hrh Princess Margaret and the memorial built in her honour.  Gardens and grounds are extensive. Lovely shop with beautiful gifts to choose from. The restaurant has some lovely food on offer too. The smoked salmon and prawn salad was delicious. Recommended. Would I like to visit again? Yes and would I recommend a visit? Yes to that too.
Glamis Castle,Robert Fillner,5,"Very nice castle between Dundee and Kirriemuir. It's a privat property, but except winter months is open every day. You pay some money on entrance. After that you can go inside by car. Parking and guidance tour are included. There is option amazing walk in a couple of parks, good food, coffee, souvenirs. Plan your visit for longer time, a half day would be fine. They close at 4 p.m., be careful with time of arriving. The ticket is not cheap, but it is value for money. You need more time for enjoying of everything what the castle and park with gardens can provide. There was a comfortable surprise for me; we received brief document which described everything in our mother tongue. I suppose when they are ready for Slovak language must be ready for any language on the world."
Glamis Castle,Steven “Stan” Cameron,5,"WOW!!!, This is right on our doorstep. We are from Dundee and at the  last minute we decided to go to glamis for a tour of the castle. We where so glad we did. Our tour guide (Abi) was outstanding,her knowledge of the history of the castle was 1st class and she brough humour into the tour which was a great addition!. The castle room where steeped in history and you felt this as you walked around. The tour was £16 each for adults which was reasonable. After the tour we ate at the restaurant which was also good,food was excellent. We then and walked around the gardens and they where beautiful,from the river walks and sculptures to the walled gardens. Was really busy with tourists from all over the world,which was great to see. We will definitely be back!"
Glamis Castle,Dougie Kirkpatrick,4,Good day out. From the guided tour of the house. To the walk in the woods with the wood carvings. A wee wander round the walled garden. We even had lunch in the restaurant. All in all a good day out and would do it again 👍👍.
Windsor Castle,Mark Punsheon,5,"I was near Windsor for work, and as I had never seen Windsor Castle before, I decided to have a drive over and take a look. Although I didn't arrive until early evening and didn't have the opportunity to go inside, it was still impressive walking around the perimeter. Such a lovely, clean, and tidy area, with plenty of nice shops, and definitely somewhere I shall visit again when I have more time."
Windsor Castle,Claire McCormack,5,"We spent a lovely few hours visiting the castle. Entry was quick and seamless after watching changing of the guard outside of the castle. There is plenty to see and you can move through the rooms at your own pace. The staff are very friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. Will definitely visit again."
Windsor Castle,Jack Mitchell,5,"This castle is massive, almost like a small town, and has great views of surrounding Windsor. You can see the long walk, the changing of the guard and the beautiful insides and rooms. A must do."
Windsor Castle,Linda Bentley,5,"A revisit to the castle, apartments amazing, dolls House so cute and detailed. Lucky enough to do the Tower tour this time. A special moment seeing the Queen and prince Phillips resting place. Just a beautiful place all round. Oh and lovely cakes in the cafe."
Windsor Castle,Nomadic Plague Doctor,5,"Holy, It's beautiful! There were rooms with many beautiful great old paintings you'll break your neck just by looking and turning around seeing just how beautiful the castle and the chapel is. The architecture dates back to the 1200s, it's worth the visit. Give it a try."
Bolsover Castle,Amy Skinner,4,"Beautiful historical place to visit, with gorgeously tended gardens and amazing ancient beech tree. The views are stunning from the castle.  However it was a bit busy for this anti social person 😉..but then it was a Saturday to be fair and clearly a really popular destination. The cafe was a bit chaotic and the staff in the cafe were pretty mardy and uninterested( they are probably over worked to be fair but a smile costs nothing) I recommend visiting, but maybe during the week instead if you struggle with crowds."
Bolsover Castle,Alan Amesbury,5,"An interesting castle with some rooms highly decorated in wall paintings some very raunchy, then others completely bare almost like work in progress. The outside fountain garden is lovely to see and well kept up, although the fountain itself was not working which is a shame. Staff were very friendly and helpful and although not a lot in the shop to purchase there was a very good section of plants outside to buy which pleased the wife."
Bolsover Castle,Sue (Suzy),3,"Parking, we found a nightmare, you could  either park next to the pub or opposite the pub. We parked in the additional parking, as there was no space in the other two. This was definitely the best option. But you could easily miss the sign as it's just off the road. The castle, especially the view's were lovely and the grounds. I found it a bit boring as there was no main attraction when we went. The rooms had very little in them. Some of the ceilings were wonderful. Staff  were very helpful. I wouldn't take young children unless it's for a picnic. They have a playground and a cafe next to each other, and a gift shop."
Bolsover Castle,David Keyworth,5,"This hilltop castle has to be the historic gem of Derbyshire, lots to explore, discover and enjoy from the ""Little Castle"" to the Riding House/Stables and Fountain Gardens. Great tearoom with good selection of food, snacks and drinks with indoor/outdoor seating, children's play area, toilets and two car parks close by ( but other large free car parks within easy walking distance) Great visit and experience and top marks to English Heritage!"
Bolsover Castle,UKCptpain,5,"An English Heritage site, so it is worth being a member to cut the entrance fee. A well worth visit I must say. Not the kind if castle I was expecting and incredibly well preserved! The staff are wonderful and the tour guides are all highly enthusiastic. They also have fantastic events on throughout the year."
Hermitage Castle,Ashley Lightfoot,5,Fantastic hidden gem of a place. Small parking area on the side of the road. Small shop but you can get a guide book and there are toilets. There are notice boards around to help guide you. Inside there are a few steps to climb and the courtyard is a bit uneven but the castle is largely complete. Some parts are fenced off and not accessible but you can get in most of it. Only a few quid to get in and there is a discount if you are an English Heritage member
Hermitage Castle,Faye Beedle,5,"A well hidden gem, the single roads to get to the site were testing especially with other drivers going at speed. It was worth it for this great monument. Very impressive building and great stories attached to it."
Hermitage Castle,Stew Walker,5,What a place! Visited on a sunny beautiful Tuesday morning. Driving there on the single track roads winding through the hills you could not see the castle till you were very close to it. Such a mind blowing and Huge castle in the middle of nowhere. Absolutely brilliant place to visit and the surrounding area is so beautiful also. The staff member at the site was so so nice and she was so helpful especially with all the questions we bombarded her with.
Hermitage Castle,Max Eaves,5,"An amazing find in the Scottish Borders. Located between the A7 and Newcastleton it's one of the finest castle ruins anywhere in Scotland. Set out in the wilds of Southern Scotland, it is a stunning example of a Border Reiver stronghold. Costs £3.50 for access to the insides of the castle. Amazing atmosphere and location. The real Scotland!"
Hermitage Castle,Ed Beach,5,"The best example of a castle from the Border Reiver period. While definitely a ruin, it was built to last so is still impressive and formidable. A corner of the castle is currently closed to visitors while the masonry in that area is rechecked; don't let that discourage you from visiting -- all the significant areas of the castle are still open (including the prisoner cells, main living tower, and entrance defenses). Toilets on-site as well as a small gift shop. Access is over a narrow, one-car wide road but don't let that discourage you either."
Dover Castle,J Grg,5,"Beautiful place perfect for a family dayout. The view from top is just spectacular. The castle, up and downhill walk around the garden is fun will keep everyone active all day.  The staff are very kind and helpful. They will help you plan the route if you're not sure where to start or if it your first time. Overall, the visit was great. Children had fun all the time.  The Castle is a must visit place."
Dover Castle,Danae Bird,5,"We'd been meaning to visit for ages and were glad we got around to it. As English Heritage members we didn't have to pay admission. There is so much to see you can't do it all in just one day so we're planning a return trip. Lots if different exhibitions with huge variety of interesting information. I was particulat taken with the origin of ""women and children first"". Excellent gift shop and nice cafes. Dog friendly too."
Dover Castle,Helen Byard,5,"Fantastic day out. Such a beautiful castle. Full of amazing history. We spoke to a very acknowledgable guide, Noel, who really enhanced the visit. He was full of interesting stories about the graffiti and the use of the castle over its timeline."
Dover Castle,Imarabbitama,5,Fantastic historical place. My kids loved the reenactment despite not understanding English. Everything very well organized. Buying tickets online or getting an English Heritage card is definitely worth it to skip the line for the entrance!
Dover Castle,Fátin,4,"Gorgeous view and super friendly staff! Little to do on Dover itself, but would definitely recommend a day trip just in the castle. With nice weather, you can even have a picnic on the castle grounds."
Sandal Castle,Iain Wooding,4,"Nice old ruins overlooking Wakefield from its hilltop location. Free entry and parking at designated hours, the carpark is small so you may have to park nearby and walk. Very popular place both for the castle and the area in general. Gives up some good photo opportunities if people get out of shot!"
Sandal Castle,N S,5,Wow didn't know there was castle ruins in Wakefield...found this by mistake...so beautiful! Lovely little walk... Free parking. we accidentally also discovered it was linked to pugney nature walk and the country park which were equally as beautiful..will definitely return in the summer with a picnic .
Sandal Castle,David Hutchinson,5,Great for lovers of history and lovers of the countryside. Free entry great views over Wakefield and the battlefield site. Also an excellent cafe  on site plus good car parking. Within easy walking distance of Sandal and Agbrigg Station on the Doncaster Leed line.
Sandal Castle,Sue Williams,4,"Ruined, but a fabulous vista of the surrounding countryside. Plenty of benches to sit and look at the view. Short circular walk round the exterior of the castle. Free car park and admission."
Sandal Castle,Rebecca Whiteley,3,"Nice place, lovely views but not somewhere you could spend the whole day nice place to kill an hour and would be a nice spot for a picnic"
Stirling Castle,M Spooner,3,Worth a visit if you don't mind 1000's of people walking around. Go early. Lots of parking in the town and surrounding roads and inside the castle grounds. Great views from the walls. Able to walk all around the castle walls. Relatively young castle compared to others in Scotland. Worth a visit though. Stirling town is quite nice to walk around too.
Stirling Castle,Bruce Sines,5,"After gaining entry we thought that joining a led tour might be nice. Then we found that most of what we were hearing we had already heard from our coach driver. Who, by the way, was a remarkable resource. That being said. If you haven't the history, etc, take the led tour. A beautifully maintained castle.  Overlooking the Stirling Bridge battlefield where Mel Gibson?  Oh wait! William Wallace routed the British soundly. Off in the distance stands the wallace monument. Inside I especially enjoyed the staff who were dressed in period attire. Who gave us tidbits of the feel of the place in their own unique way. A most enjoyable time spent."
Stirling Castle,Raf Zof,2,"I have a huge problem with this place.  The castle itself is situated in a beautiful place from where you can enjoy beautiful views.  Inside, however, it was... boring.  Of course, there was a whole historical background from which you could learn a lot of interesting things, but there were very few original exhibits and exhibitions.  To be honest, it's really nothing special.  In addition, the car park was closed and you had to sweat to find any parking space in the town.  I think that the price for the ticket is way too high because for the same price you can enter a much better place which is Edinburgh Castle.  I was much more impressed by the nearby Holy of Rude Church and the amazing looking cemetery.  Overall a waste of time and money.  I do not recommend."
Stirling Castle,Dee Dee Tweedle,4,"A day out with a difference. A great day out for anyone who likes history. Some great exhibits and very educational. Not too much for the kids, so not ideal if they tired or get bored easily. The castle is on a hill and some parts are quite steep. Most of the attraction has disabled access. There are some amazing views of the surrounding area too. There is a cafe which can get busy. The prices are not too bad for the mains, but the cakes are around £4 per slice. The hot food doesn't start until 12, so getting there early to beat the crowds doesn't really work. The castle has its own ice cream van outside, and the ice cream tastes amazing."
Stirling Castle,Andrew Bard,5,"Loved it! We went on a Tuesday aroind 1pm and it was a bit crowded but not so bad you couldn't get around or had to wait often. Of all the castles we've been to in the Highlands, this was my favorite by a long way."
Ludlow Castle,Sixty,5,"Ludlow Castle is a worth a visit. Step back in history and explore the ruins.  Tickets for adults is £8 each, but well worth it.  It sits atop a hill so you get some great views if you venture up some of the very small stairs.  Otherwise great place for kids and adults alike.  Lots of places nearby for food and drinks as well as in the grounds"
Ludlow Castle,James Ralph,5,Impressive castle and lots of hidden corridors and rooms to explore. Great if you got a dog in tow as they are welcome which is not normally the case. Visit the gift shop first if you have kids (or not) then carry your sword and shield with you as you defend the castle 😁 well worth a visit and to learn about the local history 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Ludlow Castle,Paul Wirral,4,Visited while passing to visit the town centre of Ludlow. The castle is beautifully set in a gorgeous town square and although we didn't go in you can walk around the perimeter of the castle taking in its history. Well kept paths make it a nice walk. A nice place to while away an hour or so while in Ludlow
Ludlow Castle,Naomi Lear,4,Beautiful grounds that were well maintained!! My daughter loved exploring and running round on the grass inside the castle walls. Only downside was the amount of dog mess that lazy owners had left on the grass inside the castle walls. Definitely will be back again one day
Ludlow Castle,Carolanne,5,Absolutely loved my experience here. Definitely my favourite castle I've been to. Highly recommend anyone who loves castles and history to visit here. So much to see and the admission was only £8. So so beautiful
Dunure Castle,Tara Sanders,5,"Dunure Castle, Harbour and Labyrinth. It was lovely to walk amongst the Summer flowers in the labyrinth here in June, taking in some beautiful views of the coastline and the castle from afar.  We managed to park close by the castle in the early evening for free.  I was happily surprised to find the castle open for visitors (for free). There were lots of information boards...and safety notices, this wouldn't be somewhere to visit if you feel uneasy with unstable surfaces!  The walk from the coastline to the harbour was lovely, passing little beaches along the way. The area just past the harbour was an Outlander filming location.  I'd highly recommend visiting this area on a sunny day."
Dunure Castle,Sukanya Sarkar,4,"Like this place, have been here a few times. Great views of castle ruins and good for a short hike around the castle and down to the beaches. Toilet facilities available and the car parking fee is 2 pounds cash or card, however after 3 its usually free and entry and exit are unrestricted most of the time. I like the fact there is a children play park where kids can have loads of fun while adults can enjoy a bbq overlooking the cliff. The toilets are decent and well maintained. Lots of parking spaces available."
Dunure Castle,ada tarozaite,5,"What can I say.... its breath taking beautiful, airy at the night time. One of my top favorite castle ruins in Scotland. You can go up the stairs and explore castle itself. Path leading to the beach. Parking spaces available.  Toilets too. Although wasn't needing to use  so not sure if they are open 24/7. During the day I do believe there is a small fee to pay at the entrance of the car park. Good hiking place"
Dunure Castle,Shazzi Britt,5,"Out of this would, worth every penny this it was less then £2 but it's well maintain. Even picnic tables and BBQ set ups for yourself and your family.💖 Beautiful views. Lots to do. Plus walking down to the beach. But make it more magical 🥰"
Dunure Castle,country music by dode,5,"1340s old and long history A ruins, but very interesting and a fantastic photo opportunity Easy parking and an adjacent playpark/basketball court for kids Lovely little beach and harbour only a few mins walk away May have to pay to park sometimes"
The George,S B,5,"A very welcoming pub where dogs are as well treated as the customer. We visited on Sunday meaning a specific reduced Sunday menu. This wasn't an issue as we wanted a roast. There were plenty of other menu items to choose from. The food isn't cheap but you get what you pay for, fresh, locally sourced, high quality food. You get a good portion size too and the service was fast, friendly and you get a conversation. Worth every penny. Well done the George keep it up."
The George,Gustavo Dean,1,"Do not stay here. The place is filthy dirty. We stayed here on our way home to Oxford from a family holiday in Cornwall. We spent over three hundred pounds on two rooms; one for my wife and I, and another for my 80 year old mother. After my feet were literally sticking to the carpet in our room after a shower, we decided we had enough. It was 11pm. We called the manageress and explained we wanted to leave and requested a full refund. We couldn’t even open the widows for some fresh air. The corridors wreaked of ‘Febreeze’, presumably to mask the stale odour. My mother was already asleep at this point. The manageress agreed to refund the cost of our room, but refused to refund the other. Despite trying to reason with her, she wouldn’t change her mind. I am now seeking compensation through legal channels. I’ve attached some photos. As a paying customer, I expected to receive a certain level of service and unfortunately, my expectations were not met. I would like to bring to your attention the issues I faced during my stay at this tired and filthy hotel."
The George,Jaime Spicer,5,"We asked the George at Nunney to host us following my Dad's funeral yesterday, they gave us a function room at the back of the pub and told us we could stay as long as we wished, the room was ours for as long as we wanted it.  We had agreed a cold buffet with them - there was MORE than enough food and the quality and variation couldn't have been better, with plenty of sandwiches, home made cakes, cookies, chocolate brownies, scotch eggs and fantastic sausage rolls - they did a truly wonderful job.  The room was perfect for our needs and they were happy to let us put up some photos of my late father around the room.  We couldn't have been more happy with our choice - I'd like to say a public massive thank you to Tanya and her team, it made a difficult day much more bearable."
The George,Priscilla Mensah,2,I personally would never stay again. Firstly the staff members were very nice and helpful. The food wasn't great and they were flies everywhere which was extremely off putting when trying to eating. The flies were even in my room. The George needs a professional deep clean. The blinds by the window where i was eating was full of dust. The breakfast in the morning was below average and was a long wait.  The door for my room couldn't be locked from the inside so for a lone traveller please be aware as the front door to the hotel is left opened as they is no staff at night. Beautiful village and surrounding areas but the George wasn't for me.
The George,Stephen Croak,1,"What good is offering food if you stop serving? 12:45 is a reasonable time for lunch. We got a very abrupt, you can order drinks, but not food. Another younger girl was much nicer and suggested we come back later. Plenty of empty tables. A short explanation would have been nice."
Dunskey Castle,Simon Giles,4,Wonderful and inspiring building. Amazingly constructed for strength with metre plus thick walls using a variety of stone. It must have been a remarkable sight in its time. Shame about the litter left behind by visitors. Very popular on the sunny afternoon that we visited having walked over from Portpatrick.
Dunskey Castle,Alan Oswald,5,"Nice free to enter castle. You can walk from Portpatrick fairly easily. The stairs up the hill might be tough for older folks. The path leads along the top of the cliff, over a wee bridge then you get your first glimpse of the castle.  The castle itself is pretty small but worth a visit. Nice views out over the water and a nice grass area for picnics."
Dunskey Castle,Paul Bishop,5,"We visited in mid May and the short, energetic walk from Portpatrick was lined with a wonderful variety of wild flowers. The castle was unfenced at the time we visited and you can wander round the ruins and admire the cliff views. It's a health and safety nightmare so you visit at your own risk and if you have kids then only take them if you can control them!"
Dunskey Castle,DFlix,4,"Nice walk along the cliff tops. Park at Dunskey St carpark and there's steps up to the top, also two benches on the way up if you need a breather. There's also a wooden bridge with quite a drop at once side if you're scared of heights. After that it's only a 5 - 10 min walk along to the castle. Its pretty ruined but still quite a few abits can go in.  Very scenic and peaceful place."
Dunskey Castle,James,4,"Great little walk up to the castle from Portpatrick harbour. Takes about 15mins. There is on quite steep section. But after that, quite flat. The views our over the sea and coast are stunning. The castle itself is worth seeing and worth the short hike up the hill."
Kidwelly Castle / Castell Cydweli,Anthony Bourner,5,"Great castle ruins run by CADW. Reasonable prices for a visit as the money goes towards the upkeep of welsh historic monuments. There is a gift shop and toilets on site, but no refreshments kiosk. A small car park is available on site, although the is free car parking a short walk away."
Kidwelly Castle / Castell Cydweli,Laura Dufton,4,One of the busiest castles I have been too. Dog friendly on ground levels. Free car park just before and limited at the castle.
Kidwelly Castle / Castell Cydweli,Janice Lesley,5,Great castle to visit. Grandchildren loved it! Very interesting lovely views too. Could do with a tea room .
Kidwelly Castle / Castell Cydweli,High Miler,5,"Very good castle in very good state. A brilliant ruin to explore, not overly busy and fantastic for kids. Bits of information scattered around the place. There are toilets on site and a gift shop but parking at the castle is limited, you'r better off parking down the road and walking up as theres a free car park nearby."
Kidwelly Castle / Castell Cydweli,jakki waller,5,Absolutely amazing old castle has been well looked after to allow visitors to safely walk around large areas of the building and grounds. I especially loved walking around the parapet and the amazing views from up there
Urquhart Castle,Reed B,4,"After a fabulously done introduction video you walk outside and quickly realize this isn’t a castle - it’s ruins. While hopefully you realize that before you arrive due to research, it’s still a slight letdown as there isn’t a ton to see, few artifacts, etc.  That all being said, it’s a very interesting piece of history, the views are amazing and it’s worth a 90 minute stop or so.  There is ample parking, clean toilets and a well appointed gift shop and cafe.   Be prepared to take a lot of photos, but just know what you are getting into."
Urquhart Castle,Corrine Bourdon,5,"Very good. I walk there from Drumnadrochit, because the weather was really nice & I was told it was worth it & it was. The castle itself is interesting, the view of Loch Ness is superbe. They also have a 10 minute film, to tell you the history of the castle. I went to see it, & it's good & informative."
Urquhart Castle,Julie Martin,5,We had a very nice visit to the castle and the weather was wonderful. All outdoors so that made the experience even better.  The staff were amazing. We purchased the membership pass and just pre booked online a few hours ahead. We were able to get parking at the castle.
Urquhart Castle,Shannon McCluskey,5,"Stopped off here on the Jacobite 'freedom' tour. Lots to explore around the castle and amazing facts about Scottish history. Took a lot longer to walk around than originally thought, so there is a lot to look at. Incredible views of Loch Ness from here also. So interesting to see a large part of history."
Urquhart Castle,Sarah Chalmers,5,"Absolutely stunning,  not only the castle but the views as well.  We'll worth a visit.  Do pre book parking as parking is very limited!  I suggest getting a historic Scotland membership if you are going to visit more than one of their properties."
Aberdour Castle and Gardens,David Parker,5,"The oldest castle in Scotland with remnants of various expansions over the last 800 years and well worth a visit. There are good info boards explaining the history of the castle and a nicely reconstructed terraced garden.  The garden to the rear of the castle has a dovecot in it which you can go inside as well as great views of the whole rear of the castle. The painted ceiling in the east range was possibly the highlight, along with the fantastic views. Friendly, informative and helpful staff."
Aberdour Castle and Gardens,it get,5,"A small castle ruin with a large and lovely walled garden. The castle itself is relatively small, but it has a long history. One part is the ruins, and the other part can be browsed, including some living rooms and small rooms. One of the ceilings is full of paintings, which is a bit interesting. In addition to the castle, the garden area is very large, and the grass is very comfortable to walk on. I think it's a great experience to walk or have a picnic in the sun. All in all, this castle is very suitable to come when the weather is good, to feel the history of the ruins and the beauty of the garden."
Aberdour Castle and Gardens,Keri Smith,5,"Beautiful little castle to wonder around... parking is in the railway station car park and walk up past the sign for the castle and around to the entrance. There is also a sign for an old church, which I would highly recommend a visit to as it's next door. The castle has a lot of history in it and is surrounded by beautiful grounds to walk around and enjoy. Definitely recommend a visit here. Small shop with items to purchase and cold drinks and snacks."
Aberdour Castle and Gardens,Sen Sen Lin Quan,5,Amazing castle with interesting ruins and history. We went on the 29/04/23. The lady at the front desk was absolutely amazing and welcoming. Despite the weather not being the most ideal- I enjoyed very much visiting this castle and it’s clockwise stairwell. There was also an old church next door which was magnificent
Aberdour Castle and Gardens,Liz Duncan,5,"About time that I visited this beautiful  spot. The dovecote is magical. One point I want to make, I recently took out membership with National trust for Scotland but you need to be a member of Historic Scotland to gain free entry here. There is no reciprocal agreement. My mistake. It was still worth the entry fee for a taste of architecture, garden and history. St. Fillans is the local church sitting right beside the castle gardens. It's celebrating its 900th anniversary!!! Well worth going inside and having a wander through the graveyard."
Castle Cottage Tearoom,Cristina Romero,5,"A charming place! We went for coffee and ended up having a cream tea. But they had a good variety of traditional cakes. The scone was good, although we would have preferred if they had had homemade clotted cream. But we enjoyed our cream tea anyway. The staff were lovely, from first to last. Very polite and attentive. The place was like being at home but in the past. Very tasteful, taking care of every detail. The plates, the cups, the way the food is served, ... It was a bit cool to have a drink in the garden would have been a pleasure too. Totally recommendable!"
Castle Cottage Tearoom,Monika Rozwarzewska,5,"It's a beautiful and very English tearoom (as a foreigner, I love such places), just outside the castle and next to the parking. We had a cup of tea and cake, and we will definitely come back one day!"
Castle Cottage Tearoom,Alan Mayes,5,What a fantastic place. We came down to do a walk on the Pevensey Levels and round the Castle and had lunch here before we set off. I had cheese scones with chutney and cream cheese and it was amazing! My wife had Toasted Sandwich that was also great and wonderful pot of tea. Everyone there was so friendly and found out it opened as a tea room in 1874! Everything about it is perfect and the cheese scones reminded me of the ones my Grandmother used to make! We will return many times :)
Castle Cottage Tearoom,Eve Francis,5,"A wonderful tea room with great snacks and cakes and waitrise service. Cafe is a typical old fashioned tea room serving up teas and coffees in china cups and saucers. A warm welcome is always given. Staff are fantastic.   Very popular, so it is best that you reserve a table so as not to be dissapointed in finding there is no room. Lovely surroundings with the Castle behind and an opportunity in visiting Pevensey Castle."
Castle Cottage Tearoom,Denis Parker,5,Lovely little place for tea and cake. Look out for poetry crockery and also the unusual salt and pepper Pots.  It is quite tiny but on sunny days there are tables outside right under the castle walls.  Then we come to the tea and coffee which were very good but outshone by the cakes. There were even glutton and dairy free ones. Don't miss it.
The Three Tuns,Mick Halligan,5,Unfortunately my wife couldn't travel with me at last moment to the concert but decided to travel anyway as room was paid for along with train tickets. Room was large and comfortable with oak beams and uneven floorboards that added to charm. Bathroom had same style with roll top bath etc. If I ever go back to Chepstow this is the place I would stay. Perfect
The Three Tuns,ian mumford,5,"Had a really lovely stay whilst going to the races. Staff really friendly and welcoming, great lunch and breakfast. Lovely beer garden to sit out in. Great room with a roll top bath and everything you need for a comfortable stay. Would highly recommend and certainly stay again, thank you."
The Three Tuns,jacqueline fletcher,5,"Lovely atmosphere and reasonable prices. We went for a drive out and went to Tintern Abbey and Chepstow Castle, popped in for a quick refresh before heading home 🏡"
The Three Tuns,Steve Attwood,4,"Excellent choice of beers and ciders. Unfortunately the ciders are stored in the bar so at room temperature. Lots of menu choices, good atmosphere and garden seating."
The Three Tuns,Tony Loxley,5,"a wonderfull old building (expect uneven floors ect) with beautiful period rooms in a location right next to the castle a great pub with a good range of bers ales and ciders , food and a food truck in the garden just a great little pub and b an b"
Rochester Castle,Rebecca Young,5,Incredible place… well worth a visit and a wander tho do prepare for castle steps..  buy tickets as you enter and away to go..
Rochester Castle,Peter Meade,4,"This was a fascinating place to visit. Entry prices aren’t excessive and I had a concession price too. The actual rooms of the castle have gone, but there are panels to show what was there when the castle was in use. The path through the castle goes via some steep and uneven spiral staircases, so some care is needed, especially when people are going the other way. There’s a warning at the entry, it says there are 200 steps. There are some very nice views of the cathedral."
Rochester Castle,Pravin Mistry,4,"The is an open castle part of the English Heritage. A good walk going the up stairs and seeing pictures of how each floor used to look many years. You can see the square holes in the walls of where the wooden structure use to sit. The top of castle gives you the best 360 views of Rochester especially when it's sunny. It was a bit windy when we went, best to try and go on a hot day with no breeze. Still an enjoyable visit, there a live concert and funfair event on the castle grounds. Recommend!"
Rochester Castle,shibin kurian,5,"I love visiting Rochester Castle, it's a beautiful and historic place with stunning views of the river and the town. The castle grounds are well maintained and perfect for a picnic or a stroll. Me and my fiancée have spent many romantic evenings there, watching the sunset and the lights of the bridge. The castle itself is impressive and worth exploring, especially the keep with its medieval features. The staff are friendly and informative, and the admission fee for the castle is reasonable. I would highly recommend Rochester Castle to anyone who loves history, nature, or romance."
Rochester Castle,Andy Deaves,5,"A really awesome place to visit if you love castles and historic buildings.  A great place to bring children older than 7 so they can explore a real castle, then have a family picnic on castle green."
National Trust - Dinefwr,Kali Martinez,5,"This place is gorgeous! The rooms inside the house have interesting items, it's like a small archaeology exhibition because it has items that belonged to the people that used to live there. I love the gardens. We saw a group of deer in the back one! At the front of the road that leads to the entrance, they have white coos that are unique to this place! And a small fairy-town spot! This is a really lovely place. Plus, they have interactive games/activities throughout the state — they have a giant chess board in the front garden, there's a 500 piece puzzle in one of the rooms, and one of the rooms is a library that sells cheap nice books (the ""pricey"" ones cost £3)."
National Trust - Dinefwr,Barbara Willcocks,5,"Well worth the 90 minute drive from Cardiff. We were greeted by a field of white cattle. They were lovely. We looked around the house which was very interesting and a little spooky and chilly down in the basement.  Some interesting artefacts to see and read about plus films to watch. The sofa was used in Downton Abbey and was gifted to the house. The deer park was wonderful, a lovely serene walk here through huge ancient woodland.  We were lucky to see 2 deer. Eventually we walked up a long incline in a field, through a woodland to reach Dinefwr Castle with stunning views. Definitely lots of walking and other paths to take."
National Trust - Dinefwr,Mandi Dunlop Ferraro,5,"'Beyond The Borders Festival' - a friendly, family event, with a story telling theme, held in the grounds of Dinefwr over the weekend. Plenty of space to roam, stalls to visits and a full timetable of entertainment. I had a really good day. Campsite and plenty of local accommodation are an option."
National Trust - Dinefwr,anthony smith,5,"A most excellent day at Dinefwr, my first visit, but it will not be my last. Grounds, wide and natural Castle,open accessible  and stunning views over the River Valley House full of interesting history. Big shout out to volunteer Steve, you really made our day, keep up the excellent work. Will be back in the autumn"
National Trust - Dinefwr,Paul Price,5,"The house is well worth the entrance fee. Staff are knowledgeable and welcoming. The park land is especially wonderful this time of year with a carpet of bluebells in the woods. You'll also spot deer. What with the house, woodlands and castle, a full day out awaits you. One of Carmarthenshires top tourist attractions."
The Castle House Luxury Bed & Breakfast,Sue Urwin,5,"Lovely B&B in quiet cobbled street close to the castle. Room very comfortable and Nige’s welcome was very friendly. It was a great touch to be offered a complementary drink on arrival, and the use of a parking disc. Best of all was a great breakfast including a good selection of berries, seeds and nuts, and a delicious freshly cooked breakfast. The only slight issue was the slow breakfast service, as guests were allowed to choose their time slot, and it appears we all arrived at once!"
The Castle House Luxury Bed & Breakfast,Nick Hooke,5,"The name says it all.  It is a very nice B&B with lots of classy touches.  The building is old and quirky, with lots of original features.  Nigel offered us a welcome beer on arrival, much needed after our day’s walk on the C2C. He also recommended a good restaurant.  Room was nicely appointed, with a roll top bath and a separate dressing room.   Posh toiletries!  Good hearty Yorkshire breakfast to set us on our way."
The Castle House Luxury Bed & Breakfast,Michel meuret,5,"Although we didn't actually meet Nigel, he was very pleasant and helpful on the phone. We appreciated the welcome drink and the sitting room at guests' disposal"
The Castle House Luxury Bed & Breakfast,Barry Ley,5,"Loved it. Comfortable beds, very nice and well appointed rooms. The food is also great value and great quality too. The Castle House is super convenient for this charming market town and walking distance from the pubs, restaurants, gym, castle and the river.  They are pet friendly too although I believe there is a surcharge because of the potential extra cleaning that comes with most pets"
The Castle House Luxury Bed & Breakfast,Peter Nolinge,4,Superbreakfast good food and fantastic calm relaxing music. And nice that I could be let in even if I came before opening hours. Just call the owner and he help you over the phone.
Warkworth Castle,Chris Willocks,5,Excellent day out during the school holidays if you are in the area. They had live shows on by the Silly History Boys which was brilliant and got kids joining. Well priced and all day parking for £3.50. Definitely a good day out and a great place to have a picnic.
Warkworth Castle,Betty Inskip,5,"Absolutely fabulous day out. Knights tournament was amazing, full on from 11am through to 4.30 pm. The castle ruins were extremely interesting with lots of information at strategic places, to well worth a visit."
Warkworth Castle,Emma,5,"This place is fab and well worth a visit if you’re in the area. The big plus for us is that they allow dogs, and ours LOVED it. He was up and down the hills/steps, in and out all of the little rooms and ruins having a great time! There’s a surprising amount of the castle still intact for the age of it (1400’s), and there’s lots of facts dotted about and a great audio guide that makes you feel like you’re right back in the old ages. Brilliant fun!"
Warkworth Castle,Alison Heckermann,4,"We saw the castle and decided to stop. As we are English Heritage members we didn't have to pay for the car park or entry, and we had a free audio guide. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain, so we didn't spend as much time outside as we could have. We found the facts and history about the castle very interesting. There are toilets in the car park. We were able to take our dog around the site on a lead, and there are paths around the outside for exercising your dog. There is a small shop at the entrance where tickets are purchased and gifts and drinks are sold. We would recommend a visit."
Warkworth Castle,Amanda Young,5,"Had a great visit to Warkworth Castle. Dogs allowed also. We were spending a few days in the area and came across this castle by chance. Even though it is a ruin there are lots of ""rooms"" to explore. Great little souvenir shop and really helpful friendly guides. Loved the history. Pretty village. And toilets available if required.  Always helpful."
Llansteffan Castle,Alexandra Rogers,4,"Beautiful views from the castle, 360 degrees of wonderful country and sea It is a trek from parking areas (all uphill) but lovely views on the way  If going by satnav/Google maps it'll take you down a tight, single track road and halfway there's a sign saying no parking at castle! Would be better to put the sign at the front of the lane, had to reverse all the way down! Free entry Town is also lovely, would 10/10 recommend and will revisit!"
Llansteffan Castle,Si Cooper,5,Nice walk in the sun up to the castle. The view were great. I would advice walk around the castle on the way down and loop back to the most beautiful beach. Was great to take our dog!
Llansteffan Castle,Rob McConnell,5,"Once you get up to the castle, the views are amazing. Particularly like the stone spiral staircase taking you up a couple of floors!  Free entry makes this an enjoyable,  cheap day out."
Llansteffan Castle,Laura Dufton,5,"Nice castle with a little walk up a hill. Free entry. Dog friendly. Once you've been up to the castle as you are coming back down the hill you can get to the beach. There is a dog ban on the beach Infront of llansteffan but past the play area is dog friendly beach, nice and quiet too"
Llansteffan Castle,Cyril BOIREAU,5,Nice visit worth to be done. Free to visit. Not much explanations on the castle though.
King John's Castle,Julia Alex,5,"Truly a gem.. very nice interactive museum in the castle where you get really inside the Irish history. Spacious castle yard with some fun medieval games and two viewpoints (very windy on top, not wheelchair accessible). Nice gift shop with small bistro. We are definitely happy being visiting this place. To get the best view of the castle, just cross the bridge. Great attraction for kids."
King John's Castle,Jamie Oakland,4,"Visited on a Wednesday afternoon, purchased 2x €13 Adult Tickets and entered right away (no line).  We did enjoy the history exhibits, but a lot of the exhibits were closed or non-working. They also had a lot of major construction going on internally, so these aspects made the ticket prices not quite worth it for us. Didn't feel we got the true value.  Views from the castle tops were lovely."
King John's Castle,Gavin Brophy,5,"The whole family loved this place. Free car park about 2 minutes walk. Tickets are reasonably priced. Staff are very friendly. The whole place, toilets included, was spotless. Nice cafe and gift shop at the end of the tour. Really informative, interactive self-guided tour. Nice panoramic views from the top of the castle walls and towers."
King John's Castle,Adeesh Goyel,4,"Visited the Limerick King John castle during noon time on a weekday. Not crowded, tickets are easily available, you can also book online. Firstly, in my opinion please visit the place only if you want to absorb the beautiful landscape of Limerick along the Shannon River as viewed atop the castle towers. Thats wonderful scenic views. 5 stars for it. Rest of the museum brings down the rating for the improper lighting and the way things are being depicted. No person is found directing anyone or showing the way. Tourists are free to go any which way they like and then realise they need to go back as they missed something. Once you are in the center courtyard of castle, poor directions allow you to wander in which any direction. I will not be surprised if some tourist missed on some sections of the castle just because there are no proper sign boards. The technology has been used but only to be non-functional most of the places. There is a cafe at entry-cum-exit and of course a souvenir shop, Which are good."
King John's Castle,Mike Daley,5,Tea and fresh baked pastries to start. Tourist assistance guide was great she was so enthusiastic about the region and knowledgeable gave great ideas of what to see in the area. The singer and other artists were great took time to give you real history of the castle and of music. Great time. It's funny past this by everytime I was in Ireland before stop since we had an hour or so to kill spent two hours there and loved it. The smell in the lower level is the stink of a thousand years.
Portchester Castle,Julia Damtoft,5,"Fantastic!! Worth the visit, it's a gorgeous castle with lots of information about the history. Amazing views from the top of the tower!! Definitely recommend, amazing"
Portchester Castle,Pramod Nair,4,"Managed by English heritage, but there is no free parking for members. Also the place is very popular so parking can be challenging on holidays. There are two parking spaces at walking distance. The entry to the castle grounds is free and great for picnic. The entry into castle is paid and there is audio guide available at the site. There are no toilets and the one in church/tea room is only for tea room customers."
Portchester Castle,Alison Foxford,5,"Visiting family up from Cornwall. Took myself on a road trip and found this gem. The grounds are free to walk around, but it is well worth paying the entrance fee to climb the stairs to the top of the keep and look at the exhibits and interior walls. Interesting history. Nice little mobile coffee van or a tea shoppe at the church. Spent a couple of hours here. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't buy tickets in advance but a small discount if you do."
Portchester Castle,Andrew Thomas,5,"Impressive ruined castle that began as a Roman Saxon Shore fort, subsequently expanded with a Norman keep, before becoming a royal palace in the 14th century. The ruins are extensive and largely accessible, with information boards and a handheld audio guide (which only worked intermittently when I visited). From the top of the keep there are excellent views over the grounds, church and across Portsmouth harbour. The keep houses exhibitions and restored wall paintings. Dogs on leads are allowed in the grounds there's wheelchair access to the grounds and lower levels of the keep. Entry charges for non-members can be found on the English Heritage website but seemed reasonable when I visited at £9.00 for adults, £8.10 for concessions. There are two paid parking lots near the castle (not free for English Heritage members), though both get busy by late morning so arrive early if you want to find a space easily. Toilet facilities are available by the larger parking lot. Inside the grounds there's a coffee van serving great refreshments."
Portchester Castle,Howard Kirrane,5,"So much history at this famous castle. Top Tip, join English Heritage and you can take up to 6 children for Free.  If you make the steps to the top of the Keep the views are absolutely amazing, Portsmouth Harbour, Isle of Wight and even The New Forest"
Carisbrooke Castle,Karen Ballantine,5,"Amazing castle! Visited as a child but had forgotten what an amazing fortress this place must have been.  Great walks around the walls and also up to the top of the round tower.  Interesting museum with lots of exhibits and information about the castle and the royal connections and protection.  The wheel on the well was fun although the donkey was adamant that he wasn’t coming out to work so the guide ended up being the donkey instead, fun and informative for all.  Beautiful garden also within the walls.  Plenty of walks through and around the castle.  Highly recommend for all the family."
Carisbrooke Castle,TT,5,Amazing place. So much to look around. Lots of History. Just make sure you go to the toilet before hand as there is only 1 toilet which is a joke.. Car park is walking distance and its pay & display (£3) unless your an English Heritage member then its Free...
Carisbrooke Castle,Pez1979,5,"This is a brilliant Castle, truly a hidden gem. The structures and walls are very well preserved, and the views from the Keep are amazing. I also loved the gift shop - quite a few unique items and not the usual fluff."
Carisbrooke Castle,emma staines,5,"Historically interesting castle right in the centre of the Isle of Wight. 360 deg views. Ancient ramparts, very interesting museum, warm coffee shop. Quite a few stone steps up to the keep and castle walls."
Carisbrooke Castle,Smurfie L,5,"I've been before, this time I came as part of a school trip. Due to high winds we could not walk the castle walls. However, this is still a fabulous place to visit a d swot up on local history. Great little garden and stunning views."
Dunstaffnage Castle and Chapel,Bekki Cochrane,4,"Lovely castle, with beautiful views. The castle is open all year round and free to historical Scotland members. Tickets for an adult is £7.50 for the castle and the chapel. Inside has been refloored and each of the three levels has small games for children (first floor snakes and ladders, third floor build a bridge challenge) The castle walls walk way has beautiful views of the woods, sea, beach and other surrounding areas. The chapel is a short walk from the castle in the woods and is a nice ruin."
Dunstaffnage Castle and Chapel,Marco Verkroost,4,"From a historical point of view, a very important castle. Take the trouble to get a ticket and have a stroll, read the info signs and learn. It has connections with Robert the Bruce and the Bonnie Prince. Nice little bonus is the chapel close by."
Dunstaffnage Castle and Chapel,Kaitlyn Henderson,5,We absolutely LOVED visiting Dunstaffnage! The games on each level were a perfect distraction for our little guy as we spent time learning. Such a great addition!
Dunstaffnage Castle and Chapel,James Sel,5,"A spectacular castle, friendly and helpful staff and great ice cream in the shop! I travelled with my bike, be aware there aren't any cycle spaces on site, check out the beach nearby!"
Dunstaffnage Castle and Chapel,James Ralph,5,"Great place for a gentle walk and commanding views even if you don’t go inside the castle it’s ideal for a walk with a dog, also visit the chapel in the woods, it’s a little rough in places so wear the right shoes 👞 nice bit of Scottish history to visit. Free car park a short distance away, trust the satnav as you have to drive through a industrial estate to reach it."
Dunstanburgh Castle,Simon Kimpton,4,"A wonderful example of castle ruins. This majestic spot is best reached via Craster a small harbour town 1.5 miles from the castle. Ample parking with usual, local rates leaves you with a wonderful coastal walk to ruins via agricultural land with mixed live stock grazing. Stunning coastal views lead you to the short climb up the hill yo the castle where you will be greeted by an English Heritage member who will either grant you access if you are a member or request a fee. We are with the national National Trust and are allowed in for free too... The castle has a small shop and toilets, other than that you are left to your own devices to explore the ruins and rear the info boards dotted around the site. A great half day tourist attraction. Craster has a couple of pubs and cafes to help ward off any hunger and thirst pains. To note, there is a beach beyond the castle with breathtaking views of the area, a long sweeping beach with plenty of sand at low tide. There is an access point for the beach with limited parking another mile or two up the coast from Craster."
Dunstanburgh Castle,Samuel Russell,4,"Very nice castle. Well preserved and kept by national trust. Entry was pricey at around £8 a person, but worth it. Nice walk to get there, and overall day out."
Dunstanburgh Castle,Mel Milner,5,"Lovely walk from Craster, about 1.3 miles each way.  Uneven walk as well.  There far more castle remains than can be seen from embleton.  Some great views from the tower once you get there.  The walk is past grazing sheep and cows and can get messy ! Don't wear your Gucci trainers !"
Dunstanburgh Castle,Keri Smith,5,"Beautiful! A walk along the sea which is lovely but long for those of us a little less fit... especially on the way back. I went on a very hot day. The castle was so fascinating, and the grounds were beautiful and wonderful to see the protected coastal area for the wild sea birds. A lot of walking around and then the long walk back definitely took a lot this day in the heat.. but if you brought a picnic and stopped along the way by the sea it would make the walk feel significantly shorter. There is a small shop with souvenirs and cold drinks at the castle. Plus eco toilets. Parking is limited closer to the entrance to the walk but there is a car pack not too much further away to park at. Definitely book your tickets if you're not members and go on a clear sunny day as it just makes the experience so much better."
Dunstanburgh Castle,J Simpson,4,"Lovely walk from Craster, if your not so fit please bear in mind there aren't any seats and there are 2 fields to cross with live stock, one had sheep the other had cows so remember dogs on leads and leave gates as you find them. The walk was litter free, beautiful views of the castle all the way"
Gylen Castle,Tashi Sherpa,4,"It's an interesting tower/fort.  You can forgot how much shorter they were back then, so watch your head!  You can go inside.  The path up is decent.  Please try to stick to the path and close the gates after you!"
Gylen Castle,Sebastiaan Duursma,4,A great castle at the end of a great hike on the isle of Kerrera. Beautifull views from and around the castle.
Gylen Castle,Kristy Turner,5,Interesting castle in a stunning location. This makes a great destination for a walk across Kerrera with far reaching view over to Mull and beyond. A good place to stop and watch the world go by before getting some refreshments at the bunkhouse tea room.
Gylen Castle,Allie Draper,5,"Took the 5 minute ferry over to Kerrera and walked to the Teahouse and then the castle. It is a fairly small ruin up a short steep hill, but worth it as the views are stunning."
Gylen Castle,SARAH BANCROFT,5,Stood the test of time. Free to enter and walk around. Incredible views from the castle ruins. Situated on a beautiful island. A must visit if in Oban.
Conwy Castle,Nicholas Hatton,4,I enjoyed having a look around the castle. It was quite scary going up the biggest towers. There were lovely views on top. There were some plaques which explained a little bit about the history and some historically inspired works of art.
Conwy Castle,Dale Anson,5,"Had a lovely day to close down our holiday in North Wales. On the way home we stopped off in Conwy, which is a beautiful place full of things to do. The castle is amazing, and the walls are lovely to walk across. No problem getting in,, and plenty of space to move around. Worth a visit."
Conwy Castle,Craig Williams,5,"Would 100% recommend a visit. Such a monumental building and great fun to wander around and explore - it's a bit like a rabbit warren. Very well maintained and has stunning views from the top of each of the five or so towers that are accessible to visitors.  It's slightly steep at >£11 for an adult, but I gather that annual membership is quite good value for money. The ruins cannot be cheap to maintain, either."
Conwy Castle,David Imrie,5,Lovely castle with great views even in the rain. Worth battling past the American tour parties and making your way round.  Stunning views over the bay and around the town from the wall walk. Probably not that accessible for people who can't manage spiral stairs.
Conwy Castle,Angela D,5,"Lovely day at the castle. There were lots of areas to explore and many information signs around the castle which explained more about the history, very interesting to read. Amazing views in every direction when you reach the top of the towers. My 10 year old also loved it."
Kilchurn Castle,will mcmurtrie,4,"One of my favourite castles in Scotland in terms of location and scenery. A pity it’s been closed now for a while and Historic Scotland seem in no rush to reopen. Nice walk from car park to castle, flat and relatively good surface could be Ok for wheelchair access and prams if weather is dry. Around castle is just grassy area so if wet would not be readily accessible. Free of charge for car park and to walk around outside of castle. Artwork is my own original painting from a few years ago and is copyrighted to myself obviously."
Kilchurn Castle,Alzbeta Simovicova,5,"Place itself is closed, but you can still walk around and get some great pictures. Nice short walk from the parking lot and they had highland cows roaming around! Absolutely stunning surroundings and I recommend everyone to pay a visit."
Kilchurn Castle,Ruellyn Mirfin,4,Beautiful and scenic. There is vast paved car park and a gravel path to the  castle. I loved walking passed the Highland coos and enjoying the tranquility of the location. You cannot enter the castle due to H&S reasons but nonetheless a lovely spot to enjoy.  There are no toilet facilities.
Kilchurn Castle,István Sitku,4,Ten minutes walk from the carpark. The area is breathtaking. The path is good but waterproof shoes are recommended. The castle itself is in ruined condition and fenced.
Kilchurn Castle,David Ross,5,Although the castle is fenced off its still possible to get up close and walk around the perimeter. Great scenery.
Shannon Heritage,shane hartigan,2,"I was a little disappointed, a site being marketed to tourists and not clean or correctly staffed. Wear and tear is one thing, dirt and refuse is not. Macs Bar, staff unusually curt and uninterested. And please address the tattered Irish flag atop the castle, this is not acceptable. Honestly disappointed although my guests were oblivious to this, I was not."
Shannon Heritage,Nicholas Kianka,5,"Went to a show at the castle. Very entertaining, and excellent food! These folks clearly love what they do, definitely worth a visit!"
Shannon Heritage,Tara Kiernan,5,Brilliant the scenery and views are amazing great family day out with lots to see and do we came across a car show and it was just amazing there was music going on in the street  everyone was in good spirits the sun was shing we deffently came on a good day the river shannon is the highlight of the place its amazing I will be back for a overnight stay as there is so much more to explore
Shannon Heritage,Audrey,1,"Brought my 3 children to winter lights. What a disappointment the Santa they had didn’t even resemble santa the kids observations. He didn’t even come down off the draw bridge to see them, he was 15 minutes late on a particularly cold night. Mrs Claus again didn’t resemble her again observed by the kids. She herself was a lovely lady. Also a lot of people complained about the wet foam which was meant to resemble snow I’m sure theirs is dry versions of this which would work so much better as kids were soaking wet. All in all I would not recommend this experience at all. Very disappointing to be honest"
Shannon Heritage,Maitiú Ó Fátharta,5,Great place. We'll be back for sure
Tolquhon Castle,Alan and Debbie,5,"Lovely ruin of a castle to visit,  lots of rooms to explore,  old stairs  to negotiate here and there, really enjoyed wandering around, greated by nice staff  Car parking was OK bit of single track road up to it. You can use English heritage if you have it,  we pre booked online  so easy ,not crowded  at all."
Tolquhon Castle,William Mcgregor,5,Fantastic castle to visit so many rooms and hidden stairs must of been a stunning castle in its day
Tolquhon Castle,Rob Henderson,5,Cool castle with a lot of spaces to explore.  There were more stairways open to access upper floors than most of the others in the area.  Old keep actually has stalagmites forming from water dripping through the stone and mortar.
Tolquhon Castle,Avery Collins,5,"This is one of my favourite castles. Tucked away and protected from a lot of the crowds experienced by other castles in the area, but absolutely gorgeous and perfectly well maintained. I always bring family here when they come to visit!"
Tolquhon Castle,Yas C,5,"This is a must visit Castle when your are in the area. There is a fee for going into the castle, but this is 100% worth the experience. We spent a while wandering the castle remains and were informed of the history from the staff who were super friendly and knowledgeable! The castle has a magical feel and lots of sparrows flying around adding to the feel. Beautiful views and lots of history here."
Tantallon Castle,Josie Mellor,5,A wonderful castle to visit. Reasonable entry price and fully dog friendly too! Less mobile dogs might need more help with all the castle stairs but our 13 year old managed okay with some help. Great views and a huge amount of history as well as some really nice pieces in the gift shop at the end
Tantallon Castle,Tree Wise Tree Surgeons,5,We arrived after closing time so had to make a long walk. One of Scotland’s most magnificent castles but unfortunately we didn’t get to go inside. But the view of Bass Rock and Isle of May set against the castle in the foreground is worth the visit alone. Seeing our first peregrine falcon who is currently nesting in the castle was an unforgettable experience too.
Tantallon Castle,Alice M,5,"This is a fantastic ruin to visit, and it’s free! The people that work there, and in the gift shop are very welcoming and knowledgeable. Although we were still unable to go inside the castle, as they’re doing remedial works on it, it was still a great marvel to see. Would recommend going on a nice day, taking a picnic and making the most of the scenery. I will definitely be going back when the interior is open again (which should be Aug 2023)."
Tantallon Castle,Steve Bridge,4,"Nice site.  Currently undertaking some repair work so not fully open but you can climb the ramparts.  Accessible parking is near the shop, not at the front.  Shop is small but nice and there are toilets available."
Tantallon Castle,Kaya Michaels,4,"Very cool castle, bigger than it looks from the road. Tickets were half price because parts of the castle are still closed off due. Still worth a visit, you can climb right to the top which has great views of Bass rock"
Palace of Gaudí Astorga,David Matthews,5,"Love this place, beautiful condition thankful its open to the public with pilgrim prices too"
Palace of Gaudí Astorga,Diego Barraza,5,"I heard it described as Dracula's Castle by a passer-by, this Gaudi building is a must visit for fans. You can clearly see the through line that went from this design to La Padrera in its treatment of stone, structure and form."
Palace of Gaudí Astorga,Paul Mitchell,5,"Excellent, beautiful, amazing design, I was blown away 👌"
Palace of Gaudí Astorga,Steve George,5,Beautiful building designed by Antoni Gaudi.
Palace of Gaudí Astorga,Emily Alsdorf,5,"A beautiful museum! There were some renovations happening while we were visiting but the distraction was minimal. I bought tickets online in advance (not sure if you could purchase onsite) for 10:30am on a Saturday and enjoyed the gardens and views practically to myself. I learned so much about Astorga here as well as the creation of the commissioned palace by the architect, Gaudi. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. A must see!"
Herstmonceux Castle,Kathy Turner-Hart,5,"Beautiful castle! Lovely grounds. Easy to find, ample parking, and accessible route to the castle too. It's privately owned so they only do tours on specific days, but the grounds are amazing. Little cafe, lovely kids play area, but the true beauty is walking the grounds. You can easily lose 2 hours here."
Herstmonceux Castle,Marjorie Wade,4,"Beautiful flowers in bloom in the garden.  Overgrown grass/weeds, but   nice walk around the castle grounds.  Scones dry/chewy at time of visit at  cafe.   Entry fee slightly expensive to see flowers and walk the grounds."
Herstmonceux Castle,Michael Metcalfe,5,"Great walk across the bridge into the Castle gardens and then onto the multiple rear gardens. Well maintained with beautiful flowers and shrubs. You can then walk through the woods to see the 300 year old Sweet Chestnut tree. Further around, the estate ground is a folley with gardens, then a lovely walk back around the lakes, and the moat. Fantastic day out. Would highly recommend."
Herstmonceux Castle,TiC,5,"Built to show off. Lovely castle, very little known or advertised. Downside you cannot see interiors as its a college. Still worth to visit. Lovely Gardens, and architecture."
Herstmonceux Castle,VALERIE PHILIPSON,4,"We were only able to do the gardens, but we really enjoyed a leisurely walk around.  There were plenty of benches to sit and take in the peace and tranquility.   We finished our visit off with lunch in the tea rooms.  All the ladies very nice, nothing too much trouble."
Castello di Sammezzano,Luca Weissbeck,4,An extraordinary piece of architecture. Unfortunately it has been neglected over the past years and cannot be visited from the inside anymore. The walk around the Castello is beautiful and quiet. Definitely worth a visit.
Castello di Sammezzano,LP Pua,4,It is an abandoned castle on top of a hill but it is sealed and closed to public. The hike up to the castle was very cooling and interesting.
Castello di Sammezzano,Anwaar Alshimmari,1,The status of the place should be closed! There is no visiting time! Accessible by car until the last 5 minutes you have to hike. The hike and nature is amazing but the castle is closed and deteriorated!!! I’m soooo sad this place has been neglected! Comparing the photos I see from old reviews and friends who came here years ago made me feel the amount of pain someone feels if seeing a place or someone in bad condition! This place is history.. nostalgia.. beauty.. magic!! Please take care of it and retain back the magic!!
Castello di Sammezzano,Rebecca Pittman,4,"Wish we could have gone inside to see this once majestic place, but it was an awesome hike up with the kids and well worth the trip. This was our last big hiking adventure while we were in Italy and it was so worth it. We did get a bit lost coming back but we still managed to find our way back to our car even though we had to walk through a new city we had never been to before. So if you don't like getting lost I suggest you take the same path in and out. We are adventurists though so we like to see what's the other way lol. It is so amazing to think of how old this castle is and the fact that the original builder brought in Redwoods from America to plant along the ""drive""way to his magnificent castle. The castle overlooks the city that we ended up in at the end of our hike. Quite an amazing view. If you wonder on down you will find a big abandoned structure that has great potential to be something... If you enjoy hiking and architecture this is an absolute must see while in Tuscany."
Castello di Sammezzano,Twana Burhan mohamed ali,5,"The Castello di Sammezzano, or Sammezzano Castle, is a magnificent historic residence located in the region of Tuscany, Italy. It is situated near the municipality of Reggello, approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Florence. The castle is renowned for its extraordinary architecture and rich history. The construction of Castello di Sammezzano dates back to the 16th century, although the current structure is largely the result of a significant renovation carried out in the 19th century. It was during this phase that the castle acquired its distinctive architectural style, influenced by the Moorish revival movement. The castle showcases an eclectic fusion of architectural styles, with an abundance of Moorish elements such as arches, domes, columns, and intricately carved decorations. Inside, the castle houses over 365 rooms, each with its own unique style and decoration. Throughout its history, the Castello di Sammezzano had various owners, but it was particularly notable during the period when it belonged to Marquis Ferdinando Panciatichi Ximenes d'Aragona. The Marquis dedicated many years to transforming the castle into a sumptuous residence, enriching it with precious mosaics, stucco decorations, and marble floors. After changing hands several times, the Castello di Sammezzano fell into a state of abandonment and has undergone significant deterioration in recent decades. However, thanks to the efforts of various associations and private individuals, there have been initiatives to restore and preserve this remarkable architectural gem."
Doune Castle,Oliver Whelan,5,"A most excellent visit to this Castle. It might be small but the history and it's fantastic audio guide is a must for all Monty python fans. With the added short walk by the river, it is so well worth it and highly recommended. Recommend getting there early due to small car park and maybe busy with large tours."
Doune Castle,Michele,5,A well maintained Castle where filming for Monty Python and Outlander has taken place.  Free Audio guide. We spent around 2 hours exploring the Castle rooms and grounds.
Doune Castle,Caroline Pinto,5,The interior is so well maintained with such a lot of furnishings from the past. Makes you feel that you have walked through time. Grounds are extraordinarily beautiful and the castle itself is magnificent. We were lucky to see the bird show as well.
Doune Castle,Jaime Peacock,5,"Of all the castles we visited in the UK this vacation, Doune Castle was one of, if not the most, favorite of mine. I really felt like I was stepping back in time and walking in the faded footsteps of men, women and children from before the days of yore. So many nooks and secret rooms, vast great halls and exquisite views from up top, looking down on the beautiful countryside. Whether you are a Month Python fan, or Outlander fan (I am both), this really is a must visit. We spent about 1.5 hrs here. Admission was £10, which we bought in advance, and they have two gift shops to buy souvenirs and things you need, like water and umbrellas. Following Google Maps, it's just an easy 15 minute car ride from Stirling Castle, where we had just come from."
Doune Castle,murray white,5,"Great visit, so good I have been more than once. Audio tour is included in ticket price. Its part of the TV series Outlander tour. There are stairs in the castle some of them are a wee bit tight. Good souvenir shop. Great value. Parking available."
Blackness Castle,M Spooner,5,"The best of four castle we visited in two days. Very friendly staff, made to feel welcome. Castle is well preserved and lots of history. Because it's off the beaten track a bit, it was great to explore the whole castle and take in the atmosphere and history. Got some great photos too without loads of bright jacketed people in them :) Highly recommend a visit. No coach loads of people."
Blackness Castle,K Elf,5,"This is a fun and well intact castle to visit. This sits right on the coast and can be really windy and wet, but hey, then you know you're in Scotland! There are plenty of rooms to explore, including the pier that juts out from the castle."
Blackness Castle,Holly,5,This was my most favorite castle I visited on my trip just outside Edinburgh. Not a lot of fluff and staging just a straight up castle by the sea with rooms and staircases to explore.
Blackness Castle,Sen Sen Lin Quan,5,"Staff at blackness castle were incredibly welcoming and helpful with giving directions. Blackness castle is unlike any other castle we have ever seen- it looks like a ship that cannot sail and the views of the harbour are amazing. There is lots to explore, from  great views on the top towers to the basement chambers. It has an interesting history as this castle used to inhabit important prisoners of high rank."
Blackness Castle,Wanderers Compass Travel Blog,5,This is a fantastic castle in a town so full of charm and character. Do not miss. Lots to see once you enter and the setting on the water is breath taking. Make time to walk the and grab a pint or some pastries.  This castle was also used in the filming of Outlander.
Scone Palace,Nicola Hernadi,5,"A splendid place, that is taken care of with love.. the flower decorations in the toilets, the gift shop had really nice things and a good Cafe. We loved the garden and maze so much, plus the peacocks, of course. Unfortunately we were not able to lift Excalibur, but we had fun trying it."
Scone Palace,Duncan Blakemore,5,"Had a lovely day out here. The Palace itself is stunning both inside and out, the QR code in each room to scan for information on it is a brilliant idea! Everything is so well kept. The grounds and gardens are immaculate too, obviously a lot of car and attention goes in to maintaining every aspect of the Palace, grounds and gardens. Seeing the peacocks displaying themselves all over was captivating, they're everywhere! An over all excellent experience (although we were sad there were no Highland cows when we were there)"
Scone Palace,David Todd,5,"Only visited the gardens and maze but well worth the trip. Extensive and interesting gardens, well laid out with plenty to see. Massive amounts of history, easy walks around the grounds, a genuinely fun and entertaining maze and some fascinating trees; giant redwoods and western hemlocks and scores of others. Not a cheap visit, but worth the entrance money (£11 each today, £17.50 for the palace & grounds)"
Scone Palace,Jef Henninger,1,"I don't suggest this.  It's expensive compared to castles, it only takes about a half hour to go through and you can't take pics inside.  I think there are better places to go to spend your time and money.  It should be about half the price for how short the tour is."
Scone Palace,Steve Booth,5,Great place to visit. The grounds are very well maintained and the pathways are easy to follow. The maze is great fun. It’s only a small maze but very intricate…we managed to find the statue in the middle. The house is very interesting and the guides are very helpful and extremely knowledgeable. The cafe is well stocked and again staff were very helpful.
Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,Joaquin Cheto,4,"Another great castle with a long history close to the water. The castle is well conserve but the best thing is the gardens, there are a lot of different gardens with multiple plants, trees and flowers. Very beautiful place to walk around. Also, it is a good place to skip from the rain"
Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,peter rypens,4,"Dunvegan Castle is an enchanting marvel steeped in history. Nestled against the backdrop of the Isle of Skye, its ancient walls echo tales of centuries past. The castle's beauty lies not just in its architectural grandeur, but in the meticulously preserved artifacts that offer a glimpse into the lives of its inhabitants. The serene gardens, with their tranquil loch and striking landscapes, add to the charm. A visit to Dunvegan Castle transports you to a bygone era, where legends intertwine with reality. Conveniently, a spacious parking lot awaits, with free entry granted to those with a Historic House pass, making the journey even more appealing for history enthusiasts. This experience leaves an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to explore its storied halls."
Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,Paul Cooper,5,Nice place but I thought £14 to see the outside of the castle and gardens a bit much. And I heard other folks say likewise we had our dogs so wasn't going inside. Nice gardens but £28 for 2 of us was just too much.
Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,Rick Guttery,4,It was an okay Castle to visit. But the outside and the grounds are beautiful and fun to explore. My Wife went on the Seal trip which was about 30 for £12. Saw some Seals and pups. Tons of free parking and the restrooms/toilets where very clean. Its worth the drive and visit.
Dunvegan Castle & Gardens,tine frenssen,4,"We went to the castle for a visit. We didn't spend a night here.  The parking opportunities were plenty. Nice to also have a toilet, gift shop and cafe at the parking.  The entrance fee was quite high, but we got a small student discount.  You walk a few minutes through the park before reaching the castle. We had a nice visit, the staff was friendly and helpful and even without using a tour guide, we got enough information from the leaflets in some of the rooms.  Afterwards we strolled through the garden, which was a nice extra activity.  Back at the parking we stopped for a take away coffee. It was very busy in the cafe and hot. We had to wait a long time in a queue and people kept passing us in the other direction to get out of the cafe. Not very comfortable when you're holding a hot coffee."
Whitecastle,Jo Corlis,5,What a wonderful beautiful place !! It's much bigger than expected. Beautiful and peaceful. Lovely picnic area with benches. Amazing views all around. Road to it very narrow one track. Only downside was no toilets after a long drive. Very well worth a visit
Whitecastle,Rosslyn Rose,5,The area of Gwent and Monmouthshire are full of medieval battlements so popping to a second was an easy decision. The White Castle is an 11th century fortress in the middle of nowhere. One of three castles built up from their original wooden structures by Hubert de Burgh to keep the Welsh at bay as Prince Llewelyn  was razing English castles at the time.  Most has fallen into ruin but it still holds its own on the landscape. It’s very remote with only a few parking spaces with no shelter.
Whitecastle,Steven Huggins,4,"Great little hideaway place to visit. Not much there other than the remains of the castle itself, but it looks great and isn't too busy. Very small lanes to drive down to get there too but worth it if you want somewhere to go to soak up some historical architecture."
Whitecastle,Hannah Weaver,5,We visited all three Castles this being our first. This castle is beautiful with an abundance of space either in the outer ward or inner ward for picnics. Dog friendly. The space for parking is very small. There is a small contribution/honesty box type thing. It was £3 when we visited. You just scan your card.
Whitecastle,Chris,5,"Fantastic, but still impressive ruined castle.  There’s an echo - try it.  Very limited parking and very narrow lanes on approach."
Corfe Castle,Tash Smith,5,"Absolutely fantastic place to visit. We had free tickets from the mirror paper. All staff friendly and helpful. A lot of walking. There is so much to see. There is plenty for children to do. Toilets available. Trust shop was good. Parking was a bit far away, but only £2.20 for 3 hours. Some lovely little shops nearby. The views were absolutely stunning. As you can tell by the photos I've taken. Will definitely visit again."
Corfe Castle,Steven Moseley,5,"A truly impressive castle ruin can imagine it was spectacular back in its day. Waring it is quite a walk from the car park, and it's the cheapest to park in , but total worth it for the fantastic views to be had. The site is run by national trust, who do a great job of preserving what's left of the ruins. The court yard as you enter was fab with lots of kids' activities and picnic areas."
Corfe Castle,Rijk van Romburgh,4,"Lovely day out. Took the Sandbank Ferry for the added experience. Beautiful castle and town. It's worth popping in for a visit. We didn't visit the actual castle, as we have been visiting so many of them, and it adds up (financial speaking). We did visit the fairy garden and miniature town - this will blow your little ones' minds!"
Corfe Castle,Robert Bull,5,"Great place to visit, Corfe Castle.  When you park in Carpark at base of Corfe castle it looks like a long haul to the top. Its deceiving, there are 2 ways. To the right more difficult. Straight over road and continue is a gentle climb. Car park a fair size with facility centre. refreshments.  Disabled access is good. Castle accessible partially for disabled as it is very rocky and bridges crossing ruins. Castle is well worth a visit, beautifully kept and great views, and historically interesting. Its a great visit, during holidays, children, adult activities.  The village of Corfe may be easier to park if disabled. I am not sure of parking, best look before going. Tea room National Trust, very large. Other tea rooms and shops in village. My choice is the model village tea room, great food and drink. Lovely people own this."
Corfe Castle,Tom Robinson,4,Good ruins. Nice picnic area on the grass and a few games and activities for the kids to play. Quite good tea room as well. Corfe castle area does get very busy in summer so worth going earlier in the day to ensure you can find a parking space if coming by car. Bear in mind the car parks are all a fair walk away from the castle.
Duffus Castle,evelyn lyall,3,We visited late afternoon. It was pleasant to walk around on the cut grass. There were plaques naming the former rooms within the castle. Parking and a small coffee van ( closed). Good view of airfield.
Duffus Castle,Greig Forbes,5,This is a very well preserved ruin of a castle built over 900 years ago. Beautiful countryside around Duffus Castle and only 10 minutes drive from Elgin town centre. Definitely worth visiting for an hour or so.
Duffus Castle,Jodie Thompson,5,"Lovely castle ruins in a beautiful rural setting with a gorgeous little cafe and seating area. Would definitely visit again and, it's free. Enjoy."
Duffus Castle,Maxine Bate,5,"We visited here early evening and it was very peaceful. There is a small car park and the castle is a 1 minute walk up a small slope/hill. There is a small cafe hut that is open during the day, but was closed when we arrived. This is a beautiful castle, and the grounds are very well kept. It's nice to be able to visit sites like this at any time of the day."
Duffus Castle,Robert Wilson,5,"Beautiful landmark with a decent amount to explore, possibility of seeing some frogs and also has a great little coffee shop if visiting during the day. There is a path up to main part of the castle but it is not very accessible for wheelchairs to main part of the castle. Has a small car park so good for a quick pit stop."
Bodiam Castle,Martin Jones,5,"Another National Trust place worth a visit. Car parking is coins only if you’re not a NT member (£4). It’s a lovely walk around the castle grounds and over a bridge into the ruins themselves. Lots to see inside and a couple of towers to climb up, which have steep spiral stairs and uneven steps."
Bodiam Castle,Raymond Whiteley,5,"It's been on my bucket list for many years. So 27/05/23 we visited, and we where very pleased with all the interesting things going on the castle its brilliant with all the history that you can either ask or watch some screens that tell you the story of the castle. Great fun for all ages. Nice tea rooms on site plants for sale. Also some really rare bats live in the castle."
Bodiam Castle,Peter Hart,5,"Probably the most fantastical looking castle I've seen with its moat, portcullis and towers. You can climb to the top of one of the towers up quite a steep spiral staircase. There is a room which is home to bats which you can see if you're lucky, you can certainly hear and smell them. There is a small cafe/coffee shop on the grounds where you can get an ice-cream. Dogs are allowed on site but not allowed within the castle. Would highly recommend"
Bodiam Castle,Andrew Goodwin,4,"The castle is everyone's dream of a romantic castle. 4 round towers at every corner and an imposing gate tower in the middle. Sadly it's mostly ruins, but so easy to sit and use your imagination to bring the place to life. Definitely one of our favourite places to visit."
Bodiam Castle,Jill Brook,5,Only walked around the outside after closing time on a glorious evening. Fabulous views of the castle and surrounding countryside.
Zamek Tenczyn w Rudnie,Gianluca Fiore,2,"Not sure why people rave about these ruins. There is little to nothing to see, it is in pretty bad shape and most of what is viewable is reconstructed. Not worth the ticket price but ok if you are in the area and want to have a panoramic view of it."
Zamek Tenczyn w Rudnie,Marcin Zawislak,5,Finally opened for visitors. Beautiful ruins of castle surrounded by woods. Amazing views from the tower.
Zamek Tenczyn w Rudnie,Manishi cally,5,"A beautifully preserved castle. If you are a fan of historical places,then this is a must go. Kids will also enjoy it there. There are restrooms and eateries as well. You can also feed the goats."
Zamek Tenczyn w Rudnie,Matt P,5,"Zamek Tenczyn in Rudno is nothing short of an ethereal escape to the majestic past of Poland. Nestled amidst emerald greenery, this 14th-century castle ruin is a treasure trove for history buffs, photographers, and nature lovers alike.  What truly sets the experience apart is the incredible guidance provided by the knowledgeable and charismatic guide, “Gołąbek.” His passion and deep understanding of the castle’s history are palpable, and he captivates visitors with riveting tales of knights, nobility, and ancient traditions. Gołąbek's lively narration breathes life into the stone walls and makes the ruins feel like a living, breathing entity. His presence undoubtedly elevates the visit to Zamek Tenczyn to an unforgettable experience."
Zamek Tenczyn w Rudnie,Robert Fillner,5,"Very nice castle, great nature everywhere around, nice viewpoint. As benefit you and your children can enjoy  small hair cows, like in Scotland. Good for taking pictures, for walking and learning about history at all. Short distance near Highway to Airport Krakow."
Dundrum Castle,Fionnuala McKenna,5,"Great place to stop and visit. It is free! Park in the car park and walk up. There's a green hut with lots of info. It was under construction when we visited (July 2023) but you could still visit. The view is spectacular, right across to the Mournes. There are also toilet facilities. :)"
Dundrum Castle,Carolyn D,3,"I'm only giving a 3star review at the moment because there is a lot of work going on at the castle right now. This means that visitors need to be extremely careful when walking around and you don't get to experience the real beauty.  In saying that, the views are still incredible, right down over the village and across the reserve to the amazing Mourne Mountains.  It is a short but steep(ish) climb to the castle, but it is a bit narrow and would not be suitable for wheelchair users.  The car park can facilitate around 20 cars and there are toilets on site which are clean and tidy."
Dundrum Castle,Mark Melin,5,"The castle itself is three or four stars, as far as archaeology goes, but this place has amazing views of the surrounding coastline, mountains and fields… so I’m giving it the old five star thumbs up!"
Dundrum Castle,Will Yang,4,The view at the top of castle was surprisingly nice. Enjoyed this place as a short stay in our day trip. Free entrance.
Dundrum Castle,Michelle Brenton,4,A great place to visit and an especially  picturesque spot to view the Mournes and the surrounding countryside.
Beaumaris Castle,David Imrie,5,"The greatest castle that they never built. Really nice site that clearly was designed really well. A bit of a maze but worth exploring.  My young son really loved all the passages. Awesome views from the top and loads of little nooks to explore. You can clearly see what used to be there, and what wasn't finished.  Very reasonable entrance cost and, although we were late in the day, still plenty to look at."
Beaumaris Castle,Daniel Phillips,5,"Absolutely brilliant Castle, we're English heritage members so go in completely free. Spent around 1h 30m exploring and reading everything. Fascinating being able to walk the walls and through the corridor of ""the castle that never was"""
Beaumaris Castle,gward135,5,"Lovely castle to visit even in the rain! Well worth the wonder round and exploring all the old rooms (or what could have been!). Good price and easy to park. Be sure to explore every nook and cranny! Playground and putting golf also there too. Can walk up on top and admire the view over to the mainland. Could have had a few more explaination boards for what parts/rooms could have been if it was fully built but otherwise your imagination can do most of it! Well worth a wonder of the town too for some ice cream, drinks and food."
Beaumaris Castle,Michelle Midgley,4,Nice open space and great views from the top of the castle walls. Afew puddles when walking through the castle corridors and the grass was abit boggy in places because it was a wet day so wear decent shoes/boots if it's raining ☔ I'd say it was a little overpriced for the viewing but the history of it is interesting.
Beaumaris Castle,C “Tornadoman” Kelly,5,"Visited Beaumaris Castle what an fantastic place would of been amazing and outstanding castle if it was finished, it's a shame that they don't do a few bits to finish off what it could of been, but the same time they take such good care of it in places at the time of our visit they was a stone Mason here who was doing repairs to the side of one of the towers, would be excellent if things were finished,  But you can see how much of a laboratory Castle it would of been if completed and even had a moat with water still in it a lot of castles they have had the moat drained so.was.nice to see.  Could do with some more explanation boards but  Was well worth a visit and not expensive but if your going to do the Castle tour of Wales we'll worth buying the membership card"
Lowther Castle & Gardens,Tara Sanders,5,"What an absolutely stunning place to visit. The museum was interesting,  the castle was partly ruined but still beautiful, the gardens were colourful and varied. The temporary ceramic daffodil display was lovely to see. We spent a couple of hours here but would have spent more time if we had time as we missed some of the garden and woodland walks. Definitely a 'must visit'."
Lowther Castle & Gardens,Anna Warren,5,What a brilliant place to visit. Museum was interesting and well laid out. The castle ruin was beautiful to be able to meander though. Garden grounds were very well maintained. Coffee shop/cafe was very reasonable. The kids play area is one of the best we’ve been to and a must visit if in the area with children. Nestled in the wooded gardens it’s huge with everything from toddler sand pits to zip wires. Went as a large family group of mixed ages and there was something for everyone. Will definitely visit again.
Lowther Castle & Gardens,Gemma Wilton,5,"Had a great time here! You can access the cafe and castle walls for free, but you have to pay for the exhibition and Gardens. It is £14 each and well worth it. Plenty of parking too."
Lowther Castle & Gardens,Georgina Scholick-West,4,"Beautiful place to visit. Such an interesting castle. This would be magnificent if fully restored to its former glory. The lost castle for the children and even adults who also participated in the slides. Toddlers sand pit, zip lines swings perfect for the children of all ages. The whole of the castle is well laid out and a pleasure to walk around. History of its demise in 1939 and how it was used in war time. The cafe has a lunch and tea menu, and ice cream. We had our own picnic."
Lowther Castle & Gardens,Daniella LK,5,Breathtaking.. honestly couldn’t believe how stunning and well preserved Lowther Castle and the general estate has been kept. There was so much charm and character and stories in every corner! We spent the whole day here and would go again and again if I could!
Bothwell Castle,Harry,2,The castle and immediate grounds are closed due to 'safety issues'. These same issues are at most Historic Scotland sites . A fence prevents access all around the castle although the car park nearby is still open. You can walk the section near the Clyde River and see the castle but just can't get up close.
Bothwell Castle,Rob Croydon,5,We walked from Livingstone’s birthplace in Blantyre up towards Blantyre Priory ruins and we had great views of Bothwell Castle from the opposite bank of the River Clyde. Great views of the castle but walking boots needed as the paths were quite steep in places and muddy.
Bothwell Castle,Michał Niezgoda,5,Wonderful building. We only walked around the outside area but it still made a big impression on us.
Bothwell Castle,Matt Flannigan,4,Doing some to the castle  not open yet but lovely  place  to and view  and nice  walks
Bothwell Castle,darren m,5,Stunning castle sitting next to the river clyde. Quite alot remains considering it was besieged 6 times. Well worth the visit and some nice walks along the river as well.
Spøttrup Borg,Frank Osbæck,5,"Spøtrup castle is a fantastic place to visit. The old castle, which lies behind double moats, gives an impression of seriousness and heaviness no matter when you visit it. An absolute must to visit in Denmark. The view over the countryside and the lake is unparalleled. The arrivals building has nice employees. Every year in week 30 there is Bispen's market on the castle grounds, a great experience for all ages. The medieval market has many stalls selling all sorts of medieval related things. There are knight tournaments and much more."
Spøttrup Borg,Jette Michele Herholdt,4,Great campsite during the summer holidays while it is alive. Can be highly recommended. Handicap parking is nothing to write home about....as it is in short supply
Spøttrup Borg,Andy K,5,Totally worth seeing castle.
Spøttrup Borg,totestierundkaltesbier,5,Worth seeing castle with imposing moat. Beautifully restored and with a herb garden worth seeing. All in all worth a visit.
Ty'n y Gwynt,Lucy Evans,5,"Lovely self contained accommodation, clean and modern facilities.  Great views of the sea and castle.  On the same road as Cadwaleders ice cream cafe."
Ty'n y Gwynt,Rubin Howdle,5,Fab place.  Beautifully laid out apartments with great views. These are the views from our apartment.
Ty'n y Gwynt,Dr Swogbod,5,"Wonderful holiday home, great host, wonderful area. Can't recommend highly enough"
Lochleven Castle,Heather,5,An incredibly good value experience! My young children loved the boat ride and climbing up and down to explore the different sections of the castle. There are some gorgeous views from the island/along the drive to the loch and the castle has an interesting history. Toilets on the island were also very clean. Make sure you book in advance on the website as the boat only holds 12 people and runs every 45 mins.
Lochleven Castle,Paul,4,"Two boat trips and a historic Castle for a tenner, cant go wrong!! Great cheap day out. Although you only need about an hour you are not rushed to return on the next boat."
Lochleven Castle,sarah aitchison,4,What a beautiful place to visit. So well looked after and not a bit of rubbish in site. Love how you have to get a boat across.
Lochleven Castle,Lesley Wilson,5,"We really enjoyed the visit to Lochleven Castle, including the short boat ride with the very helpful skipper. There was more to see than we had expected. If the weather is good there are plenty picnic tables."
Lochleven Castle,andzelina drzewiecka,5,"We love this castle it's a perfect place for day out, kids can explore this beautiful island and discover history of loch Leven castle. Highly recommended we had a great day😁"
Dolbadarn Castle,Claire Cronin (All Things Dark & Dirty),5,"A hidden gem, beautiful views from the castle ruins, just outside the village, a short walk from the car park through a wooded area. Dog friendly as well. Can be seen from the main road as you drive by but it can be easily missed which would be a shame."
Dolbadarn Castle,Paul Burke,5,"A lovely little hidden gem. A slight walk over a slate bridge and up some slate steps brings you to this lovely old ruin. No entry fees, you can just go in and climb the narrow stairs to the top of the tower. A great place for a picnic with tremendous views. Highly recommended."
Dolbadarn Castle,Doug Neilson,5,10 minutes from car park. Fairly steep climb and can be slippery if wet. Marvelous views down lake and up valley. Interesting 13th Cent tower and other remains.  Recommended
Dolbadarn Castle,Deedee Davies,5,Lovely little wall up through the woods. Only the tower is still standing but you can see the remains of walls from other buildings. The views p to Snowdonia are stunning too.
Dolbadarn Castle,Stuart Jones,4,"A nice old castle.  A bit of a walk uphill over rough terrain from the car park, which was frustratingly expensive (£6.50 for the whole day, but no options for just an hour or two).  Nice views from the top."
Rhuddlan Castle / Castell Rhuddlan,Stacey,5,"Visited with the children and they enjoyed it. Lovely little place with good castle ruins. Beautiful panoramic views, especially from the top of the castle tower. Carpark, toilets and a lovely gift shop. Be mindful of the big drop into the moat if visiting with kids."
Rhuddlan Castle / Castell Rhuddlan,Robert Sheppard,5,"My visit to Rhuddlan Castle was a wonderful experience. Being disabled I was apprehensive, but I was supported by the lovely staff, with photographs and a laminated map, in order to enjoy the sights of the castle, even though I was not physically able to.  I was able to drive my scooter easily around the entire preimiter of the castle, and into the inner part of the castle to. Such a gem, which I wished I visited long before I did.  Highly recommended."
Rhuddlan Castle / Castell Rhuddlan,Paula Turner-Howarth,5,Rhuddlan Castle is set in beautiful grounds with panoramic views over the countryside. There are informative boards dotted about giving you the history of Rhuddlan. A great place for a picnic with space for children to run about and explore. The car park is busy at peak times so go early! Small gift shop and toilet facilities on site. Enjoy!
Rhuddlan Castle / Castell Rhuddlan,David Lane (DangerousDave_34),5,Such an idealic surrounding with an amazing castle grounds... the history on this Castle is mind blowing the work that must have been put in to build this wow... pleasant walk around the grounds to amazing view from the tower walls... the moat walk is a breath of fresh air and the grass is so lush and green...kid friendly to the even have small wooden swords for there inner knight 😎🙌
Rhuddlan Castle / Castell Rhuddlan,Mark Cuckow,5,A nice way to spend a sunny afternoon with the kids and dogs (if you have any) wide open spaces and a castle to explore. Although more of a ruin it has been sympathetically improved to make your visit more interesting. Steel staircases have been erected inside the towers to allow viewpoints and a short wall walk. Well worth a  visit. Although the car park might prove a little cramp at busier times.
Restormel Castle,Dave Selkirk,5,"As castles go, this one is very cool. Not used for defence, but rather to watch hunting (hundreds of years ago, there's no hunting there now, don't worry). You can go through the whole castle and see everything. Advise booking in advance, you can save quite a bit by doing so."
Restormel Castle,jodiee myers,5,"Absolutely loved it here. It is so beautiful and interesting.  We had a great afternoon wandering around. I am a creative writer at heart and it was so inspiring to my writer's mind.  The lady at the ticket office was lovely, and really informative.  Thanks for a great day! Also very good parking (it's free)."
Restormel Castle,Gillian McGrath,3,"We visited here in our motorhome, and the road from the main road to the castle is very tight, especially if people have parked up on the road, a wide vehicle may struggle. The castle is situated a short walk from the car park. We paid the consession rate of 8.50 and I have to say I really struggle to find that price acceptable for what you get. The views at and from the castle are stunning. The ruins stand on the top of a mound. Some of the areas have signage to explain what that room would have been and how it would have looked. You can go up some steps to walk around the top of the castle so again good views. We noticed there was a gentleman there from English heritage who would explain things to people as well. The toilet are in a very old hut. You can walk around the outside of the castle as well. Having been on the website we were looking forward to the the trail from the Castle to the nursery, however on arrival it was clear that this was going to include walking on the road and steep inclines so we gave that a miss. Not somewhere we would return to but glad to have visited."
Restormel Castle,Pete Wall,4,"Substantial circular keep atop a small hill with views over surrounding countryside.  There are plenty of visitor information panels around the site and it is possible to walk along most of the ramparts.  There is not much evidence of anything outside the keep, but the area has been nicely planted and maintained.  A good-sized car park is available, the approach from the main road is easy. Visitor toilet facilities appeared to be available near the castle gate. Admission charges apply."
Restormel Castle,Briga Honda,5,"Stunning castle. Cost me £6.80 on the gate. They only accept cash though. The car park is quite small and free. Castle was very impressive. I got the place for myself. Climbed up the stairs and walked all the way round the wall, views from up there was outstanding as its on top of the hill. There are toilets there. Definitely recommend visiting."
Capela de São Brás,Nicole Kosters,5,Fantastically maintained and beautiful surroundings and a nice village at the foot of the castle
Bamburgh Castle,Robert Faltermeier,5,An amazing Castle with great views of the North Sea the inside of the castle is well kept and maintained and had a great mini Display on the last kingdom TV show. On hind sight we should have taken the parking on the hill next to the castle but there was a confusing sign on the drive way to the Castle that implied the parking was closed but latter on when we had a closer look the sign which had a no entry sign on it also had small print under it mentioning the closing  times of the castle parking lot and we could have parked on top. Other then that well worth a visit.
Bamburgh Castle,richard tomlinson,5,"Impressive. Informative signage. Beautiful walk around the outside of the castle, sea side walk around the castle is not easily accessible (don't wear shorts because of potential brambles). Parking ample (£4) at the fooot of the castle or up the slope. Highly recommended visit. Didn't go inside the castle."
Bamburgh Castle,R S,5,Great castle. The free tour is well worth the hour and a bit. The guide talks about the outside of the castle and local area before you get a chance to explore the well labeled interior.
Bamburgh Castle,David Snailham,5,"Golden beaches that literally stretch for miles, safe waters for paddling and swimming, beautiful seafood at the Lord Crewe pub and a choice of eateries for coffee and cakes. The castle is spectacular and imposing. You can't keep your eyes off it. Perfect place for a weekend retreat."
Bamburgh Castle,Steve Devo,5,Lots of places to explore and state rooms are full of collected items. Still a family home. Great views over the sea and surrounding lane. You can drive up to the gate if you’re not very mobile.
Oystermouth Castle,Kate Long,5,Really interesting castle with a long and rich history. The volunteer who welcomed me was really helpful & explained the 'must see' areas & their significance. A video in the visitor centre explains the history of the place and then you can just go off and explore. Amazing views across Swansea Bay from the castle walls. There's even a secret passage way! Well worth the £6 entry fee. There's a small gift shop too & some activities for smaller children.
Oystermouth Castle,Mia Thurgood,5,"Very nice castle, prices were good and family tickets are available. There is a little gift shop 2. There is a park surrounding it and the sea/beach can be viewed. My favourite bit is the glass fridge in the middle. Would definitely recommend checking it out if your in town :)"
Oystermouth Castle,Rohit Mishra,4,"A perfect visit on a sunny day. It's a old castle, not in a good shape. From top of castle you get the view of mumble piers and the sea. It takes 30 minute to explore the castle. The garden outside is a nice place to take your dog or kids. It has I think 5-6 benches to sit."
Oystermouth Castle,Joseph Emman Pineda,4,This is definitely worth a stop if you're visiting Wales. Just say you're students if you're a travelling group so you get a better rate. The castle tour was very informative. It's a relief to see the difference today from how the Welsh had been treated in the past. Long live the king. May he be a good friend of the Welsh.
Oystermouth Castle,Miss Camille Bennett,5,"We didn't manage to go inside because it was shut, which was disappointing. Looks amazing at night all lit up and the grounds are very well kept."
