Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,2
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,"I said, ""That's a lie""",3
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,4
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,5
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,On backroads at night,6
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And I was right there beside him all summer long,7
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,8
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,But when you think Tim McGraw,9
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I hope you think my favorite song,10
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,The one we danced to all night long,11
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,12
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,When you think happiness,13
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I hope you think that little black dress,14
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,Think of my head on your chest,15
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And my old faded blue jeans,16
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,When you think Tim McGraw,17
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I hope you think of me,18
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,September saw a month of tears,19
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And thankin' God that you weren't here,20
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,To see me like that,21
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,But in a box beneath my bed,22
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,Is a letter that you never read,23
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,From three summers back,24
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,25
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",26
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,When you think Tim McGraw,27

Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,When you think happiness,31
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I hope you think that little black dress,32
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,Think of my head on your chest,33
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And my old faded blue jeans,34
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,When you think Tim McGraw,35
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I hope you think of me,36
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And I'm back for the first time since then,37
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,I'm standin' on your street,38
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And there's a letter left on your doorstep,39
Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,2006,1,And the first thing that you'll read is:,40

Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,The Outside,2006,6,I tried to take the road less traveled by,5

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,1
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,It's the morning of your very first day,2
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while,3

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,It's your freshman year and you're going to be here,5
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,For the next four years in this town,6
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,7
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,"""You know, I haven't seen you around before""",8
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,9
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You're going to believe them,10
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out,11
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,"Well, count to ten, take it in",12
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,This is life before you know who you're going to be,13
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Fifteen,14
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,15
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And soon enough you're best friends,16
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool,17
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,We'll be outta here as soon as we can,18
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car,19
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And you're feeling like flying,20
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one,21
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends,22
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,When the night ends,23
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,24
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You're going to believe them,25
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,When you're fifteen and your first kiss,26
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Makes your head spin 'round,27
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,But in your life you'll do things greater than,28
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Dating the boy on the football team,29
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,But I didn't know it at fifteen,30
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,When all you wanted was to be wanted,31
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,32
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday,33
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,34
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy,35
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Who changed his mind and we both cried,36
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,37
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,You're going to believe them,38
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall",39
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,I've found time can heal most anything,40
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,And you just might find who you're supposed to be,41
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen,42
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Fifteen,2008,2,La la la la la la la la la la,43

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""",10
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,And I was crying on the staircase,11
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said",12
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",13

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,So close your eyes,19
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,Escape this town for a little while,20
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter",21
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",22
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,But you were everything to me,23
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,I was begging you please don't go and I said,24
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",25
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run",26

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"Oh, oh",33
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,I got tired of waiting,34
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,Wondering if you were ever coming around,35
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,My faith in you was fading,36
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said",37
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone,38
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,I keep waiting for you but you never come,39
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,40
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring,41
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Love Story,2008,3,"And said: ""Marry me Juliet",42

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Once upon a time,1
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,2
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,And we caught onto something,3
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,"I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me",4
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Were you just kidding?,5

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called",11
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,12

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom",14
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Everything is wrong,15
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,16

Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide",19
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Like a scared little boy,20
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,I looked into your eyes,21
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure",22
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,So here's to everything coming down to nothing,23
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Here's to silence that cuts me to the core,24
Taylor Swift,Fearless,Forever & Always,2008,11,Where is this going?,25

Taylor Swift,Fearless,The Best Day,2008,12,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,12
Taylor Swift,Fearless,The Best Day,2008,12,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,13
Taylor Swift,Fearless,The Best Day,2008,12,And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,14
Taylor Swift,Fearless,The Best Day,2008,12,I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school,15
Taylor Swift,Fearless,The Best Day,2008,12,But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,16

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,And then the cold came,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,The dark days when fear crept into my mind,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,So this is me swallowing my pride,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night",27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,And I'd go back to December all the time,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind",31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,I go back to December all the time,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right",33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,And how you held me in your arms that September night,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,The first time you ever saw me cry,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,Maybe this is wishful thinking,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,Probably mindless dreaming,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right,38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"So if the chain is on your door, I understand",40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,But this is me swallowing my pride,41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,And I'd go back to December...,43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright",46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind",47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,I go back to December all the time,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,2010,3,All the time,49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,I am not the kind of girl,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Who should be rudely barging in,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,On a white veil occasion,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,But you are not the kind of boy,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Who should be marrying the wrong girl,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,I sneak in and see your friends,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,And her snotty little family,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,All dressed in pastel,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Somewhere back inside a room,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,This is surely not,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,What you thought it would be,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,I lose myself in a daydream,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Where I stand and say,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,"Don't say yes, run away now",16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,I'll meet you when you're out,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Of the church at the back door,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Don't wait or say a single vow,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,You need to hear me out,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,"And they said ""speak now""",21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Fond gestures are exchanged,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,And the organ starts to play,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,A song that sounds like a death march,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,And I am hiding in the curtains,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,It seems that I was uninvited,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,By your lovely bride-to-be,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,She floats down the aisle,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,Like a pageant queen,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Speak Now,2010,4,But I know you wish it was me,30

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,Long were the nights when,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,My days once revolved around you,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,Counting my footsteps,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,Praying the floor won't fall through... again,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,My mother accused me of losing my mind,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,But I swore I was fine,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,You paint me a blue sky,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,Then go back and turn it to rain,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,And I lived in your chess game,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,But you changed the rules everyday,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight",11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Dear John,2010,5,Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why,12

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,"You, with your words like knives",1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,And swords and weapons that you use against me,2

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,You have pointed out my flaws again,17

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,With that same big loud opinion,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,But nobody's listening,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Mean,2010,6,Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing,37

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,How we met,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,And the sparks flew instantly,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,And people would say they're the lucky ones,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,I used to know my place was a spot next to you,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on,7

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,Miscommunications lead to fallout,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,So many things that I wish you knew,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,So many walls up that I can't break through,11

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,The Story of Us,2010,7,Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here,23

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light",4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret",5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"I'd give all I have, honey",6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,If you could stay like that,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple",11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart",12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,And no one will desert you,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Just try to never grow up, never grow up",14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,You're in the car on the way to the movies,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,At 14 there's just so much you can't do,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,But don't make her drop you off around the block,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Remember that she's getting older too,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple",25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred",26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"And even though you want to, just try to never grow up",27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said",30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,And all your little brother's favorite songs,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,So here I am in my new apartment,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"In a big city, they just dropped me off",34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,It's so much colder that I thought it would be,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Wish I'd never grown up,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,I wish I'd never grown up,38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,I could still be little,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up",41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,It could still be simple,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple",46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Won't let nobody hurt you,47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,Won't let no one break your heart,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"And even though you want to, please try to never grow up",49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh, don't you ever grow up",50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,2010,8,"Oh, never grow up, just never grow up",51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,There I was again tonight,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"Forcing laughter, faking smiles",2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"Same old tired, lonely place",3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy",4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Vanished when I saw your face,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,All I can say is,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,It was enchanting to meet you,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""",8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Across the room your silhouette,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Starts to make its way to me,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,The playful conversation starts,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Counter all your quick remarks,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Like passing notes in secrecy,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,And it was,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Enchanting to meet you,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,All I can say is,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I was enchanted to meet you,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,This night is sparkling,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Don't you let it go,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'm wonderstruck,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Blushing all the way home,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'll spend forever,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Wondering if you knew,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I was enchanted to meet you,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,The lingering question kept me up,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"2AM, who do you love?",26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I wonder 'til I'm wide awake,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,And now I'm pacing back and forth,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Wishing you were at my door,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,"I'd open up and you would say ""hey""",30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,It was,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Enchanting to meet you,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,All I know is I was,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Enchanted to meet you,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,This night is sparkling,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Don't you let it go,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'm wonderstruck,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Blushing all the way home,38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'll spend forever,39

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Don't you let it go,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'm wonderstruck,43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Dancing around all alone,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'll spend forever,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Wondering if you knew,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I was enchanted to meet you,47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,This is me praying that,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,This was the very first page,49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Not where the storyline ends,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,My thoughts will echo your name,51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Until I see you again,52
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,These are the words I held back,53
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,As I was leaving too soon,54
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I was enchanted to meet you,55
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Please don't be in love,56
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,With someone else,57
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Please don't have somebody,58
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Waiting on you,59
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Please don't be in love,60
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,With someone else,61

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'm wonderstruck,66
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Blushing all the way home,67
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'll spend forever,68
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Wondering if you knew,69
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,This night is flawless,70
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Don't you let it go,71
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'm wonderstruck,72
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Dancing around all alone,73
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,I'll spend forever,74
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Wondering if you knew,75

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,With someone else,78
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Please don't have somebody,79
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Enchanted,2010,9,Waiting on you,80
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"Ha, time for a little revenge",2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him",4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She took him faster than you can say sabotage,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it",7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,I underestimated just who I was dealing with,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She underestimated just who she was stealing from,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She's an actress, whoa",12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's better known for the things that she does,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"On the mattress, whoa",14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,On the playground won't make you many friends,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!",18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me",25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She's an actress, whoa",28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's better known for the things that she does,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"On the mattress, whoa",30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,On the playground won't make you many friends,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!",34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"You might have him, but haven't you heard?",36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"You might have him, but I always get the last word",38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"Whoa, whoa-ah-oh",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She's an actress, whoa",41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She's better known for the things that she does,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"On the mattress, whoa",43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,On the playground won't make you many friends,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!",47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"'Cause I don't think you do, oh",49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"I don't think you do, I don't think you do",51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,Let's hear the applause,52
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,"Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)",53
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,See you deserve some applause,54
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,'Cause you're so much better,55
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,2010,10,She took him faster than you could say sabotage,56
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,I guess you really did it this time,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Left yourself in your warpath,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Lost your balance on a tightrope,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Lost your mind trying to get it back,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Always a bigger bed to crawl into,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,And everybody believed in you?,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"It's alright, just wait and see",9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Your string of lights is still bright to me,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been",11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Did some things you can't speak of,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,But at night you live it all again,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,If only you had seen what you know now then,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you",19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Before the monsters caught up to you?,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"It's alright, just wait and see",22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Your string of lights is still bright to me,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Ohwho you are is not where you've been,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"32, and still growing up now",27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Who you are is not what you did,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Time turns flames to embers,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You'll have new Septembers,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Every one of us has messed up too,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Lives change like the weather,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,I hope you remember,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Today is never too late to be brand new,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"It's alright, just wait and see",36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Your string of lights is still bright to me,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been",38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,"32, and still growing up now",41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Who you are is not what you did,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,You're still an innocent,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,Lost your balance on a tightrope,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,2010,11,It's never too late to get it back,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,You and I walk a fragile line,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I have known it all this time,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,But I never thought I'd live to see it break,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,It's getting dark and it's all too quiet,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,And I can't trust anything now,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"Whoa, holding my breath",7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Won't lose you again,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Something's made your eyes go cold,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Something's gone terribly wrong,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,You're all I wanted,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't turn back now I'm haunted,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Stood there and watched you walk away,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,From everything we had,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,But I still mean every word I said to you,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,He will try to take away my pain,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,And he just might make me smile,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,But the whole time I'm wishing it was you instead,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"Oh, holding my breath",24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Won't see you again,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Something keeps me holding onto nothing,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Something's gone terribly wrong,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,You're all I wanted,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't turn back now I'm haunted,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I know,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I know,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I just know,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"You're not gone, you can't be gone, no",38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Something's gone terribly wrong,41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Won't finish what you started,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I thought I had you figured out,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Can't turn back now I'm haunted,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh),47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,You and I walk a fragile line,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,I have known it all this time,49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Never ever thought I'd see it break,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Haunted,2010,12,Never thought I'd see it,51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I still remember the look on your face,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Lit through the darkness at 1:58,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,The words that you whispered,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,For just us to know,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,You told me you loved me,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,So why did you go away?,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Away,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I do recall now the smell of the rain,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Fresh on the pavement,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I ran off the plane,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,That July 9th,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,The beat of your heart,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,It jumps through your shirt,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I can still feel your arms,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,But now I'll go sit on the floor,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Wearing your clothes,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,All that I know is,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I don't know how to be something you miss,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Never imagined we'd end like this,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,"Your name, forever the name on my lips",21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I do remember the swing of your step,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,"The life of the party, you're showing off again",23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And I roll my eyes and then,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,You pull me in,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I'm not much for dancing,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,But for you I did,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father",28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,But now I'll go sit on the floor,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Wearing your clothes,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,All that I know is,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I don't know how to be something you miss,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Never imagined we'd end like this,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,"Your name, forever the name on my lips",38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are,41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Hope it's nice where you are,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And I hope the sun shines,43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And it's a beautiful day,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,And something reminds you,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,You wish you had stayed,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,You can plan for a change in weather and time,47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,But I never planned on you changing your mind,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,So I'll go sit on the floor,49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Wearing your clothes,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,All that I know is,51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I don't know how to be something you miss,52
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,I never thought we'd have a last kiss,53
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Never imagined we'd end like this,54
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,"Your name, forever the name on my lips",55
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Just like our last kiss,56
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Forever the name on my lips,57
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Forever the name on my lips,58
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Last Kiss,2010,13,Just like our last,59
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind",1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,The time we stood with our shaking hands,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,The crowds in the stands went wild,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,We were the Kings and the Queens,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And they read off our names,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,The night you danced like you knew our lives,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Would never be the same,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,You held your head like a hero,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,On a history book page,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,It was the end of a decade,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,But the start of an age,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Long live the walls we crashed through,12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I was screaming long live all the magic we made,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And bring on all the pretenders,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"One day, we will be remembered",16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I said remember this feeling,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I passed the pictures around,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Of all the years that we stood there,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,On the side-lines wishing for right now,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,We are the Kings and the Queens,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,You traded your baseball cap for a crown,22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,When they gave us our trophies,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And we held them up for our town,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And the cynics were outraged,25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"Screaming ""this is absurd""",26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Cause for a moment a band of thieves,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Long live the walls we crashed through,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I was screaming long live all the magic we made,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And bring on all the pretenders,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I'm not afraid,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Long live all the mountains we moved,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I was screaming long live that look on your face,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And bring on all the pretenders,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"One day, we will be remembered",38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Hold on to spinning around,39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Confetti falls to the ground,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,May these memories break our fall,41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Will you take a moment?,42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Promise me this,43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,That you'll stand by me forever,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,But if God forbid fate should step in,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And force us into a goodbye,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,If you have children some day,47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,When they point to the pictures,48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Please tell them my name,49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Tell them how the crowds went wild,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Tell them how I hope they shine,51
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,Long live the walls we crashed through,52
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"I had the time of my life, with you",53
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through",54
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,55
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I was screaming long live all the magic we made,56
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And bring on all the pretenders,57
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I'm not afraid,58
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved",59
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,60
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"And long, long live that look on your face",61
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,And bring on all the pretenders,62
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,2010,14,"One day, we will be remembered",63
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Elevator buttons and morning air,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But right now my time is theirs,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves,5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,They'll judge it like they know about me and you,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,"The jury's out, but my choice is you",8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,So don't you worry your pretty little mind,9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,People throw rocks at things that shine,10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And life makes love look hard,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But this love is ours,13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,You never know what people have up their sleeves,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And you'll say,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Don't you worry your pretty little mind,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,People throw rocks at things that shine,20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And life makes love look hard,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But this love is ours,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong,24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong",25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,With this song for you,27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And I love the riddles that you speak,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,'Cause my heart is yours,31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,So don't you worry your pretty little mind,32

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,And life makes love look hard,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,Don't you worry your pretty little mind,35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,People throw rocks at things that shine,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But they can't take what's ours,37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,They can't take what's ours,38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,"The stakes are high, the water's rough",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Ours,2010,15,But this love is ours,40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Last night I heard my own heart beating,1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Six months gone and I'm still reaching,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Even though I know you're not there,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"I was playing back a thousand memories, baby",5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Maybe I've been going back too much lately,7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,When time stood still and I had you,8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You would, you would if this was a movie",10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,11
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",12
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",13
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I know that we could work it out somehow,14
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,15
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I know people change and these things happen,16
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,But I remember how it was back then,17
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing,18
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,19
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street",20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Flashback to the night when you said to me,21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you""",22
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Not before I knew how much I had to lose,23
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",24
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You would, you would if this was a movie",25
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,26
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",27
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",28
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I know that we could work it out somehow,29
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,30
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on",31
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone,32
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I just want it back the way it was before,33
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,And I just want to see you back at my front door,34
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"And I say ""Come back, come back, come back to me like",35
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,You would before you said it's not that easy,36
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Before the fight, before I locked you out""",37
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,But I take it all back now,38
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",39
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You would, you would if this was a movie",40
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Stand in the rain outside till I came out,41
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Come back, come back, come back to me like",42
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry",43
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,I know that we could work it out somehow,44
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now,45
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,You'd be here by now,46
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,It's not the kind of ending you want to see now,47
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Baby, what about the ending?",48
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now",49
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,If This Was a Movie,2010,16,Thought you'd be here by now,50
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"Tall, dark, and superman",1
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away,2
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,To save the world or go to work,3
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,It's the same thing to me,4
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition",5
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him,6
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"I hang on every word you say, yay",7
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"And you smile and say, ""How are you?",8
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"I say, ""Just fine""",9
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you forever",10
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,I watch superman fly away,11

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,"But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah",20
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin',21
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Superman,2010,17,He's not all bad like his reputation,22

Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights,1
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,Busy streets and busy lives,2
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,And all we know is touch and go,3
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,We are alone with our changing minds,4
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,"We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time",5

Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,So you were never a saint,14
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,And I've loved in shades of wrong,15
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,We learn to live with the pain,16
Taylor Swift,Red,State of Grace,2012,1,Mosaic broken hearts,17

Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati,1

Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Memorizing him was as easy as knowing,15
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,All the words to your old favorite song,16
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword,17
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,And realizing there's no right answer,18
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Regretting him was like wishing you never found out,19

Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes,25
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go",26
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,But moving on from him is impossible,27
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,When I still see it all in my head,28
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,In burning red,29
Taylor Swift,Red,Red,2012,2,Loving him was red,30

Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,Put your lips close to mine,1
Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,As long as they don't touch,2
Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,"Out of focus, eye to eye",3

Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,Getting swept away,14
Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,I hear the sound of my own voice,15
Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,Asking you to stay,16
Taylor Swift,Red,Treacherous,2012,3,And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along,17

Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold",1
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I,2
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Left my scarf there at your sister's house,3
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",4
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Oh, your sweet disposition",5
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And my wide-eyed gaze,6
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate,7
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,8
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And I can picture it after all these days,9
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more",10
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all",11
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,'Cause there we are again on that little town street,12
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me,13
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well",14
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Photo album on the counter,15
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Your cheeks were turning red,16
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,17
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team,18
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,You taught me about your past thinking your future was me,19
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do",20
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to,21
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,22
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,23
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah",24
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And maybe we got lost in translation,25
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Maybe I asked for too much,26
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,27
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,'Till you tore it all up,28
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well",29
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,30
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,31
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,32
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well",33
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it,34
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,I'd like to be my old self again,35
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,But I'm still trying to find it,36
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,37
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,38
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,39
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,40
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah",41
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Because there we are again when I loved you so,42
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,43
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",44
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all",45
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all",46
Taylor Swift,Red,All Too Well,2012,5,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",47
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters,1
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,"And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh",2
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight,3
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,"To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh",4
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,Yeah,5
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time",6
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,"It's miserable and magical, oh yeah",7
Taylor Swift,Red,22,2012,6,Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines,8
