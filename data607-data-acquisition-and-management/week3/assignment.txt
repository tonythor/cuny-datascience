#1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.comâ€™s College Majors dataset 
[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], 
provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"

#2 Write code that transforms the data below:
[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
[13] "olive"        "salal berry"

Into a format like this:
c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", 
"blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", 
"elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", 
"olive", "salal berry")



The two exercises below are taken from R for Data Science, 14.3.5.1 in the on-line version:

#3 Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
(.)\1\1
"(.)(.)\\2\\1"
(..)\1
"(.).\\1.\\1"
"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"
#4 Construct regular expressions to match words that:

Start and end with the same character.
Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)
