Using the information you collected on movie ratings, implement a Global Baseline Estimate recommendation system in R 
(or Julia...)  Most recommender systems use personalized algorithms like “content management” and “item-item 
collaborative filtering.” Sometimes non-personalized recommenders are also useful or necessary. One of the
 best non-personalized recommender system algorithms is the “Global Baseline Estimate.


The job here is to use the survey data collected and write the R code that makes a movie recommendation 
using the Global Baseline Estimate algorithm.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for implementation details. You may work 
with a partner on this project, but either person should be willing and able to present your code in class!
